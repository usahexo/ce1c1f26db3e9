#  DSM-5 Leads to More Casino Gambling Addictions

The American Psychiatric Association’s (APA) recently released the DSM-5 has caused more casino gambling addictions. The new edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has redefined pathological gambling as an “impulse control disorder” instead of an addiction.

The DSM-5 also eliminates the term “addiction” from other disorders such as substance abuse, pyromania, kleptomania and trichotillomania. This change means that more people will likely be diagnosed with these disorders and receive treatment for them.

Pathological gambling is now listed in a chapter on “other impulse control disorders” which also includes intermittent explosive disorder, tourette syndrome and pyromania. Gambling addiction is described as a condition in which people are unable to resist urges to gamble, even if it leads to negative consequences such as financial problems, family conflicts or criminal activity.

Critics of the DSM-5 say that the new definition of pathological gambling will lead to fewer people being diagnosed and treated for the disorder. They argue that by removing the term “addiction” from other disorders, the APA is sending a message that these conditions are not really serious problems.

Supporters of the DSM-5 say that the changes were necessary in order to reflect the latest research on mental health disorders. They argue that impulse control disorders are more accurate descriptions of these conditions than addictions.

The debate over the DSM-5 is likely to continue for some time, but one thing is clear – the new edition has already led to more casino gambling addictions

#  DSM-5 Highlights Need for Better Screening for Gambling Addiction

Gambling addiction is a problem that is often underestimated and underdiagnosed. The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) highlights the need for better screening for gambling addiction.

Gambling addiction is a type of impulse-control disorder. People with gambling addiction are unable to resist the urge to gamble, even if they know that it is causing harm to themselves or to their loved ones. Gambling addiction can lead to financial ruin, job loss, and problems in personal relationships.

The DSM-5 defines gambling addiction as “a persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior that causes significant distress or impairment.” The behavior must meet three criteria:

1. PATTERN OF GAMBLING BEHAVIOR – The person must have exhibited a pattern of gambling behavior that meets the diagnostic criteria. This includes excessive spending on gambling, chasing losses, borrowing money to gamble, lying about gambling, and committing crimes in order to get money to gamble.

2. IMPACT ON LIFE – The person’s gambling behavior must cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. This includes problems such as falling behind on bills, losing interest in activities once enjoyed, engaging in illegal activities to get money to gamble, neglecting responsibilities because of gambling, and experiencing relationship problems because of gambling.

3. DEPENDENCE ON GAMBLING – The person must exhibit signs of dependence on gambling, such as needing to gamble more and more money to get the same rush or feeling of excitement, lying about how much money has been lost or won while gambling, hiding evidence of gambling from loved ones, and risking important relationships and financial stability because of gambling.

If you suspect that you or someone you know may have a problem with gambling addiction, it is important to seek help. There are many resources available for people with gambling addiction including therapy, self-help groups, and medication management.

#  DSM-5 Criteria Applauded as More Accurate Way to Diagnose Gambling Addiction

The DSM-5 has been applauded as the most accurate way to diagnose gambling addiction. The new criteria takes into account the frequency, intensity, and problems caused by gambling.

Previously, gambling addiction was diagnosed using a list of symptoms that did not consider how often someone gambled or how much money they lost. Gambling addiction is now recognised as a real and serious mental health disorder.

The DSM-5 criteria are based on research that has shown that gambling addiction is a real illness that can be treated. The new criteria will help to ensure that people with gambling addiction receive the treatment they need.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help. There are many resources available for those who need it.

#  Improved Detection of Gambling Addiction Thanks to DSM-5

The American Psychiatric Association has released the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which includes a new diagnosis for gambling addiction. The previous edition, DSM-IV, did not include gambling addiction as a diagnosable condition.

The DSM-5 redefined gambling addiction as an "impulse control disorder." The previous definition of pathological gambling was limited to "illegal gambling." This change will make it easier for clinicians to diagnose and treat problem gamblers.

Gambling addiction is a serious mental illness that can destroy families and lead to financial ruin. The new definition of gambling addiction will help to ensure that more people get the treatment they need.

#  DSM-5 a Catalyst for Improved Treatment Options for Gambling Addicts

DSM-5, the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, has been a catalyst for improved treatment options for gambling addicts according to Dr. Richard Rosenthal, medical director of addiction services at Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan, Connecticut.

Gambling addiction was officially recognized as a mental disorder in the DSM-5, which was released in May 2013. This change has led to increased awareness of gambling addiction and its symptoms, as well as increased funding for research into the causes and treatments for this disorder.

Rosenthal noted that there are still few effective treatments available for gambling addicts, but said that the recognition of gambling addiction in the DSM-5 will help to change that. "There is a lot of work that needs to be done," Rosenthal said. "But this is a huge step forward."

According to Rosenthal, one reason that effective treatments for gambling addiction are lacking is because this disorder is often not taken seriously by patients or their families. "Gambling is considered a moral issue rather than a mental health issue," Rosenthal said. "This puts people with gambling problems at a disadvantage when seeking help."

The recognition of gambling addiction in the DSM-5 will help to change this perception and make it easier for people with gambling problems to get treatment. Increased funding for research into the causes and treatments for gambling addiction will also help to improve our understanding of this disorder and lead to more effective treatments.
