#   borderlands 2 how to be able to get more vault symbols on slot machine

If you're looking to get a lot of vault symbols on the slot machine in Borderlands 2, then you're going to need a strategy. There's no one surefire way to make sure you walk away with a lot of them, but there are some things you can do to increase your chances.

First and foremost, it's important to understand how the slot machine works. Each time you spin, the machine will give you a three-symbol result. The symbols will be from one of the five different vaults in the game, and each vault has its own unique set of rewards.

Your goal is to try and match as many symbols as possible from the same vault in order to get its corresponding rewards. For instance, if you match three symbols from the Mercury vault, you'll receive coins, eridium, and weapon chests. If you want to maximize your chances of getting these rewards, it's best to focus on one particular vault at a time.

Fortunately, there are a few ways to help increase your chances of landing matching symbols. One method is to use grenades that have been gifted to you by Lilith or Marcus. These grenades have a chance to add an extra symbol to the reels for that spin, which can obviously help improve your chances of winning big.

You can also use Moxxi's slot machines in Sanctuary to help out. By spending some eridium at her machines, you can spin the reels an extra time for free. This can be helpful if you're close to getting a matching set of symbols for a particular vault but just need that one last spin to complete it.

Finally, it's worth noting that different characters have different bonuses when it comes to the slot machine. For example, Axton is able to activate his turret ability once per day which gives him an automatic win on the next spin. Play around with all of the different characters until you find one that gives you an edge while playing the slot machine.

#  Is it possible to cheat at the Borderlands 2 slot machines? 

Yes, Borderlands 2 slot machine cheating is possible, and there are a few methods that players have discovered to help them get an edge on the game. 

One method is to use a buffing item like The Bee or Raphael’s Shield while playing the slot machines. These items will help you to win more money when playing the slots. Another method is to save your game before playing the slots, and then reload your game if you don’t get the results you want. This will allow you to try again until you get the payout you want. 

There are also a few glitches that can be used to cheat at the Borderlands 2 slot machines. One such glitch is called “The Slotter Pop” and it can be used to get free spins on the slots. To do this glitch, you need three friends and two of them need to stand on either side of the machine that you are playing on. Then, your friend needs to jump on top of the machine and start spinning the reels. Your other friends need to keep jumping on top of the machine until it glitches and gives you free spins. 

Another glitch that can be used to cheat at the Borderlands 2 slot machines is called “RNG Manipulation”. This glitch allows you to control which symbols come up on the reels. To do this glitch, you first need two pieces of paper and some pens or pencils. Next, you need to write down all of the symbols that can appear on each reel of a slot machine (you can find this information online). Then, fold each piece of paper into fourths so that each symbol is hidden inside one of the folds. 

After that, place one folded piece of paper into each shoe and make sure that they are both facing inwards so that nobody can see what symbols are inside them. Now, spin the reels by jumping onto the machine and hope for the best! If one of your symbols comes up on the reels, unfold one of your pieces of paper to reveal which symbol it is. If it’s not what you were hoping for, reload your game and try again.

#  Mastering the slot machines in Borderlands 2 - The ultimate guide!

Welcome to my guide on how to become a Borderlands 2 master when it comes to the slot machines! I will cover everything from the basics, such as where they are located and how to play them, all the way up to some more advanced techniques that can help you get those sweet, sweet legendary rewards.

So, let's get started! The first thing you need to know is where the slot machines are located. They are scattered throughout all of the game's areas, but tend to be grouped together in certain places. The easiest place to find them is in Sanctuary, where there are three machines right next to each other. There are also machines in Moxxi's Bar and Marcus' Shop in Sanctuary, as well as numerous others located throughout the game.

Playing the slots is simple - just insert your coins and press the button corresponding to the machine you want to play. There are three different machines - one with three cherries, one with three bars, and one with three sevens. You'll want to aim for the sevens machine as it has the best odds of winning a prize. Pressing the button will spin the reels and then stop them. If any of the symbols on the reels match then you'll win a prize depending on what type of symbol it is.

Here's a breakdown of what each type of symbol pays out:

Cherries - Three cherries in a row pays out 5 times your bet amount.

Bars - Three bars in a row pays out 25 times your bet amount.

Sevens - Three sevens in a row pays out 200 times your bet amount.


As you can see, playing the sevens machine gives you by far the best chance of winning a prize - so make sure you give it a go!

Now that you know how to play, let's move on to some more advanced tips that can help you win even more prizes from the slots:

- Always bet max coins - This gives you the best odds of winning a prize.
