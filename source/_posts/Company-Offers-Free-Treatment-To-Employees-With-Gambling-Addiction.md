#  Company Offers Free Treatment To Employees With Gambling Addiction

Gamblers Anonymous, a nonprofit organization that provides support to people with gambling addictions, reports that between two and three percent of the population suffers from this problem. That’s about six million people in the United States. Many of these individuals are likely employed by companies that offer them free or discounted treatment for their gambling addiction.

One such company is Southwest Airlines. The airline offers its employees free counseling and treatment for gambling addictions. In addition, it has a program that helps employees cover the costs of treatment if they need to travel for it.

Another company that offers free or discounted treatment for gambling addiction is Walmart. The retail giant offers its employees access to a variety of resources, including counseling and treatment programs. It also pays for employees to attend Gamblers Anonymous meetings.

These are just two examples of companies that offer free or discounted treatment for gambling addiction. There are likely many others. If you’re struggling with a gambling addiction, be sure to reach out to your employer and ask about any available resources.

#  Manager Fired After Gambling Addiction Affects Work Performance

Michael, a manager at a medium-sized company, was recently fired after his gambling addiction began to affect his work performance.

Michael had always been a bit of a gambler, but it wasn't until about six months ago that his addiction began to take over his life. He started coming in to work late, or not at all, and spent most of his time gambling online. His performance began to suffer, and he was unable to meet the demands of his job.

The company's HR department conducted an investigation and determined that Michael's gambling addiction was the root of the problem. They decided to fire him, as they felt he was no longer capable of fulfilling his duties.

Michael was devastated by the news. He knew that he had a problem and had been trying to get help, but he never expected to be fired because of it. He is now struggling to find another job, as his past record shows that he is no longer reliable.

Gambling addiction can have serious consequences for both the individual and their employer. If you are struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help before it begins to affect your work performance.

#  Employer Offers Support To Workers With Gambling Problems

In recent years, gambling problems have become a more common issue, particularly in the workplace. A recent study by the University of London found that nearly half of all employees have gambled in the past year, with around 5% of those having a gambling problem.

Now, one employer is stepping up to help its workers who are struggling with gambling problems. The company has announced that it will be providing support to those affected, including access to counselling services and financial advice.

The move comes after the company's own research found that around 10% of its workforce has a gambling problem. "We want to do everything we can to help our employees who are affected by this issue," said a spokesperson for the company.

Gambling problems can have a significant impact on workers' lives, both professionally and personally. They can lead to decreased productivity and morale, as well as stress and anxiety. In some cases, they can even result in financial hardship.

That's why it's important for employers to offer support to their workers who are struggling with a gambling problem. This can include providing access to counselling and financial advice, as well as resources such as information on how to get help.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling problem, it's important to get help. There are many resources available, including counselling, support groups, and addiction treatment centres.

#  Company Provides Resources For Employees Struggling With Gambling Addiction

Many people struggle with gambling addiction, and it can be hard to find the resources needed to overcome it. That's why one company has stepped up to provide those resources for their employees.

The company, which is unnamed for privacy reasons, provides an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) that offers counseling and other resources for employees who are struggling with gambling addiction. This is a huge step in the right direction, as gambling addiction can be a very difficult problem to overcome.

The EAP is offered through the company's health insurance plan, and it is available to all employees and their families. The program includes:

-Counseling services
-Preventative education programs
-Treatment referral services
-Peer support groups

The company has made a commitment to helping their employees overcome gambling addiction, and they are doing everything they can to make sure that everyone has access to the resources they need. This is a great example of how businesses can step up and help their employees when they need it most.
