#  When Did the Milford Internet Casino Open Letou?

The Milford, Delaware-based casino Letou (formerly Touch Lucky) went live in early 2019. Prior to that, there was a good deal of speculation and anticipation surrounding the Letou Casino as it related to Milford, DE. Prominent among these was the question of when the Milford, DE Letou Casino would open.

Touch Lucky operated a number of successful online casinos for UK players. In early 2018, it rebranded as Letou and announced its intention to expand into new markets including the US. At that time, there was much talk about how the US online gambling market was opening up with the repeal of PASPA and about how big operators like Wynn were getting into the market.

But it wasn’t until January 2019 that there was any concrete news about when the Letou Casino might launch in Milford, DE. That’s when an announcement came that the casino had received its license from Delaware regulators and that it would open its doors soon.

The exact date for the launch wasn’t given, but by all indications it would be within a matter of weeks. And true to their word, the casino went live in early February 2019.

# What Kind of Games Are Offered at Letou?

Players at Letou will find a wide range of games available, including slots, table games, and live dealer games. There are also some unique offerings that you won’t find at most other casinos, such as horse racing betting and a lottery game called keno.

Slots are obviously a big part of any casino offering and Letou is no exception. Some of the more popular slot titles include Starburst, Gonzo’s Quest, Fluffy Favourites, and Rainbow Riches. But there are plenty of other slots to choose from as well.

For those who enjoy table games, there are plenty of options available as well. You can choose from classics like blackjack and roulette or try your hand at some more exotic fare such as baccarat or Casino War. And for those who prefer to play against live dealers rather than machines, there are several live dealer options to choose from as well.
