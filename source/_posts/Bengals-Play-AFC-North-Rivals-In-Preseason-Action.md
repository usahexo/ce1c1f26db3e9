#  Bengals Play AFC North Rivals In Preseason Action

The Cincinnati Bengals will kickoff the NFL preseason against AFC North rivals Baltimore Ravens. The game is scheduled to kickoff Thursday, August 10 at 7:30 PM at Paul Brown Stadium.

This is the first time in five years that the Bengals have faced the Ravens in the preseason. In their last meeting, the Bengals lost 20-17. The Bengals are 17-10 all time in preseason games against Baltimore.

Baltimore is coming off a 3-13 season and will be looking to get back on track with new head coach, John Harbaugh. The Ravens have made the playoffs six times in the last 10 years, but have not won a playoff game since 2007.

The Bengals are coming off an 8-8 season and failed to make the playoffs for the second consecutive year. Cincinnati has made the playoffs six times in the last 10 years, but has not won a playoff game since January of 1991.

The Bengals are favored by three points in this matchup.

#  Bengals Wide Receiver A.J. Green Fined For Voicing His Opinion

Bengals wide receiver A.J. Green was fined $42,000 for his comments directed towards an official in the team's Week 6 loss to the Steelers, according to a report from Ian Rapoport of NFL.com.

"I thought it was a horrible call," Green said after the game, via ESPN. "I thought it was Cincinnati against Pittsburgh, not officials against Cincinnati."

Green's comments weren't the only ones by players that drew a fine this week. Raiders guard Kelechi Osemele was fined $24,309 for his actions in Week 8 against the Bills. Osemele was assessed an unnecessary roughness penalty and a taunting penalty in the fourth quarter of the game.

It has been a common occurrence this season for players to be fined for their actions on the field. In Week 7 alone, Lions defensive lineman Akeem Spence and Packers cornerback Damarious Randall were both fined $18,231 for their play against the Panthers and Cowboys, respectively.

#  Former Bengals Running Back Cedric Benson Arrested

Former Bengals running back Cedric Benson was arrested over the weekend in Austin, Texas on charges of boating while intoxicated and refusing to provide identification.

This is not Benson's first run-in with the law - he has been arrested four times since 2005. In March of this year, Benson was charged with assault after punching a bar employee in the face.

Benson was a productive player for the Bengals during his time with the team, rushing for over 4,000 yards and 32 touchdowns. He played for Cincinnati from 2008 until 2012, when he signed with the Green Bay Packers. Benson was released by the Packers after only playing 3 games with the team.

#  Giovani Bernard Looks To Bounce Back From Injury-Plagued rookie Season

Giovani Bernard looked every bit the part of a future star in his rookie season – until he got injured. The Pro Bowl-caliber running back out of North Carolina averaged 5.9 yards per carry and totaled 1,209 scrimmage yards (773 rushing, 436 receiving) and eight touchdowns (seven rushing, one receiving) in 2013 before a torn ACL ended his season after just 10 games.

Bernard is fully recovered from the injury and is looking to pick up where he left off last year.

"Physically I feel great," Bernard said during OTAs. "I'm just anxious and ready to get back out there."

The Bengals offense will look much different this season with the departure of veteran wide receivers A.J. Green and Marvin Jones. That should create more opportunities for Bernard in the passing game this season.

"I would say absolutely (I'll have a bigger role in the passing game)," Bernard said. "With losing those two guys, someone's gotta step up and be a playmaker."

Bernard is confident that he can be that player for the Bengals this season. He's put in the hard work this offseason to make sure he stays healthy and productive for 16 games.

"Just continue to rehab, do what I've been doing," Bernard said of his offseason plan. "I've been getting in the weight room, doing a lot of pool therapy, working on my balance, just trying to sharpen everything up."

The Bengals are counting on Bernard to bounce back this season and help carry them deep into the playoffs.

#  Cincinnati Bengals Nearing Completion Of $200 Million Stadium Renovation

July 21, 2019

The Cincinnati Bengals are in the final stages of their $200 million stadium renovation. The project, which began in January of this year, is expected to be completed in time for the team’s home opener on September 22nd against the San Francisco 49ers.

New features of the stadium include a larger videoboard, more suites and club seating, and an updated concourse. The renovation will also add new restaurants and bars to the venue.

The Bengals originally proposed a $250 million renovation, but later scaled it back due to concerns about rising costs. Team owner Mike Brown said that the goal is to make Paul Brown Stadium “the best facility in the NFL”.

The stadium’s original construction cost $455 million and was completed in 2000. It has since been used as a model for other NFL stadiums, including Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium and Los Angeles’s soon-to-be-completed Rams Stadium.
