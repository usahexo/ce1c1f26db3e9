#  Is blackjack 7 gambling allowed in Islam?

There is some debate over whether or not blackjack 7 gambling is allowed in Islam. The minority opinion of some Islamic scholars is that blackjack 7 gambling is not allowed because it involves the element of chance, which is prohibited in Islam. The majority opinion, however, is that blackjack 7 gambling is permissible as long as it is done in a responsible and principled manner.

Islamic law requires that all forms of gambling be avoided, as they are seen as sinful activities that can lead to social ills. However, there is a distinction to be made between games of chance, such as blackjack 7 , and games of skill, such as chess or poker. While activities like blackjack 7 involve an element of chance and are therefore prohibited by some Islamic scholars, other scholars argue that these activities can be considered permissible if they are done in a responsible manner and do not cause harm to oneself or others.

Gambling has been around for centuries and can be traced back to ancient Rome and China. While there are different types of gambling, the basic premise remains the same: one party risks something of value with the hope of winning more than they lose from the other party. Gambling can be addictive and lead to financial ruin, which is why it is generally frowned upon by most religions.

Islam is no exception in this regard, and Muslim scholars have long argued over the permissibility of gambling. Some say that it is strictly forbidden while others argue that there are cases where it can be permissible. Ultimately, it depends on the individual and their understanding of Islamic law. If you are unsure about whether or not blackjack 7 gambling is allowed in Islam, then it is best to consult with a religious scholar for clarification.
