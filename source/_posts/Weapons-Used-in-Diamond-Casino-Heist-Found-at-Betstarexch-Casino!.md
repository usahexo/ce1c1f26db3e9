#  Weapons Used in Diamond Casino Heist Found at Betstarexch Casino!

On December 1, 2019, law enforcement officials at Betstarexch Casino in Las Vegas announced that they had recovered a number of firearms used in the recent diamond heist at Diamond Casino. Three handguns and an assault rifle were found in a black duffel bag at the casino.

The weapons were all traced back to purchases made by the suspects in the heist. The handguns were traced to purchases made by Amir al-Rahmani and Kevin Brown, while the assault rifle was traced back to purchase by Darnell Franklin.

This is a major development in the case, as it provides concrete evidence linking the weapons to the suspects. It also puts pressure on al-Rahmani and Brown, who are already facing charges for conspiracy to commit robbery.

Franklin has not yet been arrested or charged in connection with the robbery. However, it is likely that he will soon be brought up on charges as well.

The discovery of these weapons is a major breakthrough for law enforcement officials in their efforts to catch those responsible for the diamond heist. It is hoped that this discovery will lead to more arrests and ultimately bring those responsible for this crime to justice.
