        <h1 id="NBA-Finals-Odds-Can-Thunder-Overcome-Steph-Curry-and-the-Warriors"><a href="#NBA-Finals-Odds-Can-Thunder-Overcome-Steph-Curry-and-the-Warriors" class="headerlink" title="NBA Finals Odds: Can Thunder Overcome Steph Curry and the Warriors?"></a>NBA Finals Odds: Can Thunder Overcome Steph Curry and the Warriors?</h1><p>The 2017 NBA Finals are set to begin on Thursday, June 1, with the Golden State Warriors hosting the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Warriors enter the series as overwhelming favorites, with odds as low as -600 at some sportsbooks. The Thunder come in as underdogs at +400.</p>
<p>The start of the series is a rematch of the 2016 Western Conference Finals, which the Warriors won in seven games. The Thunder enter this year’s Finals healthier than they were last year, but they’ll still be without Andre Roberson, who is out with a ruptured left patellar tendon.</p>
<p>The Warriors are led by Steph Curry and Kevin Durant. Curry is averaging 27.5 points per game this postseason while shooting 43% from three-point range. Durant is averaging 26.4 points per game and is shooting 51% from the field. The Thunder will need to find a way to slow down both of these players if they want to have a chance at winning the series.</p>
<p>Russell Westbrook has been carrying the load for the Thunder this postseason. He’s averaging 34.8 points per game while shooting 41% from three-point range. However, he’s also averaging 11 turnovers per game. If Westbrook can cut down on his turnovers and continue to score at a high level, the Thunder have a chance at winning the series.</p>
<p>The Warriors are coming into this series as heavy favorites, but that doesn’t mean that the Thunder can’t win it. Oklahoma City has proven that they can compete with Golden State, and they should not be underestimated. If Westbrook plays like he has been playing and the rest of the team steps up, they have a chance at upsetting the Warriors and winning their first NBA title.</p>
<h1 id="Oklahoma-City-Thunder-vs-Golden-State-Warriors-Game-3-Betting-Preview"><a href="#Oklahoma-City-Thunder-vs-Golden-State-Warriors-Game-3-Betting-Preview" class="headerlink" title="Oklahoma City Thunder vs Golden State Warriors Game 3 Betting Preview"></a>Oklahoma City Thunder vs Golden State Warriors Game 3 Betting Preview</h1><p>The Golden State Warriors will be looking to take a 3-0 series lead when they take on the Oklahoma City Thunder at the Chesapeake Energy Arena in Game 3 of their NBA Western Conference Finals matchup on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Warriors were impressive in their 116-101 victory over the Thunder in Game 2 of this series as they shot 49 percent from the field and 42 percent from 3-point range. Kevin Durant led the way for Golden State with 33 points, 13 rebounds and six assists, while Stephen Curry added 29 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists.</p>
<p>Durant is averaging 34.5 points and 11.5 rebounds in this series, while Curry is averaging 26.5 points, 9.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists. Klay Thompson is also averaging 20 points in this series.</p>
<p>The Thunder are coming off a disappointing performance in Game 2 where they shot just 37 percent from the field and 23 percent from 3-point range. Russell Westbrook led Oklahoma City with 27 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds, while Paul George added 25 points and 12 rebounds.</p>
<p>Westbrook is averaging 31 points, 10 assists and 9.5 rebounds in this series, while George is averaging 28 points, 12 rebounds and 4.5 assists. Carmelo Anthony is averaging 13 points and 6.5 rebounds in this series.</p>
<p>The Warriors are 7-point favorites in this game, with the over/under set at 218 points. Golden State has won eight of their last 10 games against the Thunder overall, but Oklahoma City has won two of their three meetings against the Warriors this season.</p>
<p>Thunder vs Warriors betting tonight offers some good options for both experts and novice sports bettors! </p>
<p>  The Western Conference Finals continue on Sunday night as the Golden State Warriors travel to Oklahoma City to take on the Thunder in game 3! After winning game 1 convincingly 115-86, GSW came out a little flat in game 2 losing by only 5 pts 116-101 after Kevin Durant hit a clutch three pointer towards the end of the game to seal it! With Steph Curry still not playing up to his MVP standards (mainly because he’s sharing ball handling duties with Durant) GSW cannot afford another loss if they want to make it back to the NBA Finals for a chance at defending their title!   On the other side, you have OKC who looked horrendous offensively in game 2 only shooting 37% from the field which included going just 23% from downtown! Russell Westbrook had a triple double but it wasn’t nearly enough as Paul George was cold all night shooting only 36% combined from field goal &amp; 3 point land! This game is crucial for OKC who now trail 0-2 &amp; would need to win 4 out of 5 games to move on!   So what do we expect from game 3? In my opinion we should see more of an effort defensively from both teams as neither could pull away offensively in game 2! I am also expecting GSW to slow down the tempo of the game which should work better for them considering how many turnovers they had last game (17). Lastly I’m taking GSW -7pts in what should be another close match up!</p>
<h1 id="Oklahoma-City-Thunder-is-a-Betting-Underdog-in-Game-4"><a href="#Oklahoma-City-Thunder-is-a-Betting-Underdog-in-Game-4" class="headerlink" title="Oklahoma City Thunder is a Betting Underdog in Game 4"></a>Oklahoma City Thunder is a Betting Underdog in Game 4</h1><p>The Oklahoma City Thunder has a lot of work to do if they want to win the series against the Golden State Warriors. The Warriors are currently up 3-0 in the series, and odds are not in the Thunder’s favor.</p>
<p>In Game 4, the Thunder is expected to be a 9-point underdog. If you’re considering betting on this game, it might be in your best interest to wait until later in the series.</p>
<p>The Thunder definitely has a chance to win Game 4, but they will need to play much better than they have so far in the series. If they can manage to pull off the upset, it will give them some much-needed momentum as they head into Game 5.</p>
<h1 id="5-Sports-Gambling-Lines-Oklahoma-City-Thunder-Look-to-Bounce-Back-in-Game-5"><a href="#5-Sports-Gambling-Lines-Oklahoma-City-Thunder-Look-to-Bounce-Back-in-Game-5" class="headerlink" title="5. Sports Gambling Lines: Oklahoma City Thunder Look to Bounce Back in Game 5"></a>5. Sports Gambling Lines: Oklahoma City Thunder Look to Bounce Back in Game 5</h1><p>The Oklahoma City Thunder will attempt to bounce back and take a commanding 3-2 series lead over the Utah Jazz in Wednesday night’s pivotal Game 5 matchup.</p>
<p>The Thunder looked out of sync offensively throughout the majority of Game 4 and found themselves down by as many as 20 points. Oklahoma City was finally able to get some stops defensively in the fourth quarter, but it was too little, too late as they fell 92-96.</p>
<p> Westbrook led all scorers with 28 points on 11-of-27 shooting, but no other Thunder player scored more than 14 points. George shot just 6-of-21 from the field and 1-of-8 from three-point range. Carmelo Anthony had another dismal game, scoring just four points on 2-of-11 shooting.</p>
<p>The Jazz were led by Joe Ingles, who scored 20 points on 8-of-12 shooting, including 4-of-7 from three. Rudy Gobert added 18 points and 15 rebounds, while Donovan Mitchell chipped in 17 points. Ricky Rubio dished out 10 assists.</p>
<p>Oklahoma City is favored by 5.5 points in Wednesday’s Game 5 matchup. The total is set at 212 points.</p>
