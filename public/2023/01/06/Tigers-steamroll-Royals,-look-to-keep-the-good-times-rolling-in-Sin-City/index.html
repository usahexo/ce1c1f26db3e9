        <h1 id="Tigers-steamroll-Royals-look-to-keep-the-good-times-rolling-in-Sin-City"><a href="#Tigers-steamroll-Royals-look-to-keep-the-good-times-rolling-in-Sin-City" class="headerlink" title="Tigers steamroll Royals, look to keep the good times rolling in Sin City"></a>Tigers steamroll Royals, look to keep the good times rolling in Sin City</h1><p>The Detroit Tigers continued their early-season domination on Wednesday night, taking down the Kansas City Royals by a score of 10-1. It was another convincing victory for the surging Tigers, who are looking to carry their winning ways into Sin City this weekend.</p>
<p>Miguel Cabrera led the way offensively for Detroit, going 3-for-4 with a home run and three RBIs. Jordan Zimmermann was also impressive on the mound, scattering six hits over eight innings while striking out eight batters.</p>
<p>With the win, Detroit improved to 9-2 on the season and moved into first place in the AL Central division. They’ll look to stay in first place with a win over the Royals on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Things are certainly looking up for the Tigers after a slow start to the season. In addition to their hot play of late, they also got some good news on Wednesday when starter Justin Verlander was cleared to start throwing again. Verlander has been sidelined since early April with a triceps injury, but is now on track to return to the rotation within the next few weeks.</p>
<p>If Verlander can return and pitch like he did prior to getting injured, Detroit’s starting rotation will be one of the best in baseball. And if they can keep up their current level of play, there’s no reason why they can’t make a deep playoff run later this year.</p>
<h1 id="Detroit-Tigers-take-on-the-gambling-establishment-as-contenders"><a href="#Detroit-Tigers-take-on-the-gambling-establishment-as-contenders" class="headerlink" title="Detroit Tigers take on the gambling establishment as contenders"></a>Detroit Tigers take on the gambling establishment as contenders</h1><p>The Detroit Tigers are having their finest year in many years. At the All-Star Break, they had a document of 47-43 and were just 2 video games back of the Cleveland Indians for first area in the AL Central. Many are stating that this is finally the year that the Detroit Tigers make a deep playoff run.</p>
<p>A big factor for the success of the Detroit Tigers this season has actually been the play of slugger Miguel Cabrera. Cabrera is on track to have his most effective season ever. He currently has 23 homers and 73 RBIs.</p>
<p>However, some individuals are questioning whether or not the gambling establishment will be a weight on the Tigers as they advance further into the playoffs. Gambling establishments have actually long been connected with baseball and there are numerous tales of groups falling short because of their betting issues.</p>
<p>The Toronto Blue Jays were one such group. In 1993, 3 players from the Blue Jays were implicated of taking part in a sports betting ring. The group had an excellent season up until that point, but with all of the distractions, they lost in the very first round of the playoffs.</p>
<p>In 2007, 16 members of the Boston Red Sox were implicated of taking part in a similar betting ring. The Red Sox likewise had a great season up until that point, however eventually lost in 4 games in the World Series.</p>
<p>It will be intriguing to see whether or not the gambling establishment could become a weight on the Detroit Tigers as they make their playoff run.</p>
<h1 id="Pitcher-Justin-Verlander-looks-to-lead-Detroit-Tigers-to-victory-over-gambling-establishment"><a href="#Pitcher-Justin-Verlander-looks-to-lead-Detroit-Tigers-to-victory-over-gambling-establishment" class="headerlink" title="Pitcher Justin Verlander looks to lead Detroit Tigers to victory over gambling establishment"></a>Pitcher Justin Verlander looks to lead Detroit Tigers to victory over gambling establishment</h1><p>Las Vegas odds makers are giving Detroit Tigers a +105 money line advantage in today’s game against the gambling establishment. This means that for a $100 bet on the Tigers, a gambler would win $105 if Detroit wins the game.</p>
<p>In addition to the money line, the over/under for this game is set at 8.5 runs. The Tigers are currently averaging 4.8 runs per game, while the gambling establishment is averaging 5.1 runs per game. This would suggest that the under may be the wiser play, as neither team is projected to score more than nine runs in this game.</p>
<p>The Tigers will send Justin Verlander to the mound today. Verlander has been one of the best pitchers in baseball this season, posting an 8-4 record with a 2.45 ERA and 1.05 WHIP. He has also struck out 114 batters in 107 innings pitched this season. The gambling establishment will counter with Mike Bolsinger, who is 3-2 with a 4.35 ERA and 1.37 WHIP in eight starts this season.</p>
<p>Detroit Tigers are 6-1 in Justin Verlander’s last seven starts against a team with a winning record and 4-1 in his last five home starts against a team with a winning record. Las Vegas odds makers have made Detroit Tigers -115 favorites in this game, so there is some value to be had betting on them today.</p>
<h1 id="Slugger-Miguel-Cabrera-aims-to-clout-Tigers-to-success-at-gambling-establishment"><a href="#Slugger-Miguel-Cabrera-aims-to-clout-Tigers-to-success-at-gambling-establishment" class="headerlink" title="Slugger Miguel Cabrera aims to clout Tigers to success at gambling establishment"></a>Slugger Miguel Cabrera aims to clout Tigers to success at gambling establishment</h1><p>Miguel Cabrera is one of the top hitters in Major League Baseball, as well as one of the best players in the game. It comes as no surprise, then, that MLB’s Detroit Tigers have leaned on Cabrera to provide some much-needed offense as they try to make a run at a gambling establishment.</p>
<p>Cabrera has not disappointed, hitting two home runs in an important recent victory over the Minnesota Twins that pushed Detroit closer to a postseason berth. The slugger says he doesn’t feel any added pressure when playing in a gambling establishment, but just wants to help his team win.</p>
<p>“I don’t really think about it too much,” Cabrera said of his team’s gambling aspirations. “I just go out there and try to do my job and help the team win.”</p>
<p>That job has become even more important as Cabrera enters the final years of his brilliant career. The Tigers will need their superstar slugger to continue leading the way if they’re going to make a serious run at a gambling enterprise.</p>
<h1 id="Tigers-look-for-another-win-against-the-gambling-establishment-in-their-series"><a href="#Tigers-look-for-another-win-against-the-gambling-establishment-in-their-series" class="headerlink" title="Tigers look for another win against the gambling establishment in their series"></a>Tigers look for another win against the gambling establishment in their series</h1><p>In the matchup against the Reds in game 1 of this series, Cincinnati was a -135 favorite with the Tigers as +115 underdogs. Detroit looked to take care of business early, scoring 5 runs in the first inning. The Tigers bullpen held on to that lead and they pulled out the 7-5 victory.</p>
<p>Despite being heavy favorites, it has not been an easy road for Detroit when it comes to betting odds this year. In their match up against Kansas City on Tuesday night, they were listed at -165 while KC was at +145. Detroit games have been averaging around -155 on the moneyline all season long.</p>
<p>Now they will take on the Reds once again with Sonny Gray taking his turn in the rotation. Gray has had a rough go of it since being traded from Oakland, but showed some signs of life in his last start against Toronto. He gave up 3 runs over 5 innings pitched and will look to build off that outing tonight.</p>
<p>Joe Jimenez will also be called upon for relief duties and is coming off a tough outing himself. In his last appearance he allowed 2 earned runs over 1 inning pitched. This volatility is something that can often lead to opportunities for contrarian players when looking to place bets on these games.</p>
<p>The Reds will counter with Luis Castillo who is also coming off a decent start in his most recent outing against Milwaukee. Over 6 innings pitched he allowed 2 runs while striking out 7 batters. He will hope to keep the Tigers bats at bay and notch another victory against them here in Cincinnati.</p>
