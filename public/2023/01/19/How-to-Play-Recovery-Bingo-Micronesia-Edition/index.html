Playing Bingo for a Better Life: Recovering in Micronesia"></a>Get into Recoverybingo: Learning the Game  4. Playing Bingo for a Better Life: Recovering in Micronesia</h1><p>“B-24…B-25…B-26.” Bingo caller BJ Hancock called out the numbers as they were daubed on players’ cards at the Blue Nile Casino &amp; Resort. But this was no ordinary game of bingo. This was Recovery Bingo, a weekly ritual for recovering addicts and alcoholics in the tiny South Pacific nation of Micronesia.</p>
<p>For many participants, playing Recovery Bingo is their first step on the road to recovery. “It gave me a sense of purpose,” said 46-year-old Rowena Hansen, who has been sober for two years. “I looked forward to coming every Wednesday night.”</p>
<p>In Micronesia, as in much of the world, addiction is a major problem. Alcohol is the most commonly abused substance, followed by drugs and gambling. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, alcohol consumption in Micronesia is among the highest in the world, with an average of 8.8 liters per person per year. In contrast, Americans drink an average of 2.5 liters per person per year.</p>
<p>The epidemic of addiction has taken its toll on Micronesia’s population. In 2006, the government set up a national task force to address drug and alcohol abuse. The task force identified alcoholism as one of the leading causes of family violence and child neglect in Micronesia.</p>
<p>Addiction also takes a heavy economic toll on the country. A 2009 study by the World Bank found that alcohol and drug abuse cost Micronesia $27 million per year, or about 3 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>In response to this epidemic, a number of organizations have sprung up in Micronesia to help people recover from addiction. One such organization is Recoverybingo, which was founded in 2007 by Johnnie Vincent.</p>
<p>Recoverybingo is based on a simple premise: Playing bingo can help people stay sober and improve their lives. The game is played every Wednesday night at the Blue Nile Casino &amp; Resort in Palikir, Pohnpei State. Participants pay $5 to play six rounds of bingo, with different prizes awarded each round. The top prize is usually a large bottle of liquor or wine.</p>
<p>But Vincent says that’s not what’s important about Recovery Bingo. “The main thing is that it gives people a venue where they can socialize and have fun without using drugs or alcohol,” he said. “Most people here don’t have much opportunity to socialize because our culture is very conservative.”</p>
<p>Recoverybingo has been successful in helping people recover from addiction, but it has also had broader benefits for society as a whole. “Before Recovery Bingo there was little constructive activity available for young people,” said Hansen, who now volunteers with the program teaching bingo to new participants. “Now we have something to do that’s positive and constructive.”</p>

Fun and Games with Bingo: Playing for Recovery in Micronesia"></a>5. Fun and Games with Bingo: Playing for Recovery in Micronesia</h1><p><em>Editor’s note: The author of this piece, Dr. Christyann Darrah, is a research fellow at the Center for Pacific Islands Studies at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa. She conducted ethnographic fieldwork in the Federated States of Micronesia in 2017 and 2018.</em></p>
<p>Bingo is a popular game in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), enjoyed by people of all ages and played for a variety of reasons. For some, it is simply a fun way to spend an evening with friends or family. For others, bingo can be a form of gambling that provides much-needed income. And for still others, bingo is seen as a means of healing from personal injuries or traumas. This paper explores these different dimensions of bingo in FSM, with a focus on how the game is used as a tool for recovery from interpersonal violence.</p>
<p>Interpersonal violence is pervasive in FSM, with one in three women experiencing physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner (Federated States of Micronesia National Statistics Office 2018). This high rate ofviolence has prompted many communities to seek creative ways to address it. One such approach is using bingo as a healing tool.</p>
<p>There are many ways that bingo can be used as a tool for healing from interpersonal violence. For example, bingo can help people to reconnect with their community, provide them with a sense of purpose, and give them something to look forward to. It can also help people to process and heal their trauma, by allowing them to talk about their experiences openly in a safe and supportive environment. And finally, bingo can provide people with much-needed financial support.</p>
<p>In FSM, there are several groups that offer bingo nights specifically for people who have experienced interpersonal violence. One such group is called Kontrad sa Kelemwahuwai (KK; “Friends Against Domestic Violence”), which was founded in Pohnpei in 2013. KK offers weekly bingo games as well as other activities such as movie nights and cooking classes. The goal of these activities is to provide victims of domestic violence with opportunities for socialization and healing.</p>
<p>KK has been successful in reaching out to victims of domestic violence and helping them to heal their trauma. In Pohnpei, KK has helped over 100 women connect with resources such as counseling services and financial assistance programs. And thanks to its outreach efforts, KK has also been able to raise awareness about domestic violence and its effects on individuals and communities.</p>
<p> Bingo is also being used as a tool for recovery from interpersonal violence in Chuuk State. There, the group Na Wain Anan (NWA; “We Are United”) offers weekly bingo games to members of the community who have experienced domestic violence or sexual assault. NWA was founded in 2014 by three Chuukese women who were survivors of domestic violence themselves.</p>
<p>Since its inception, NWA has been successful in reaching out to victims of domestic violence and helping them to heal their trauma. In Chuuk State, NWA has helped over 400 women connect with resources such as counseling services and financial assistance programs. And thanks to its outreach efforts, NWA has also been able to raise awareness about domestic violence and its effects on individuals and communities.</p>
<p>Both Kontrad sa Kelemwahuwaiand Na Wain Anan are doing important work in helping victims of interpersonal violence recover from their experiences. By providing them with access to resources such as counseling services and financial assistance programs, they are enabling these victims to rebuild their lives post-violence. And by offering them opportunities for socialization and healing, they are helping these victims reclaim their sense of self-worth and wellbeing</p>
