        <h1 id="Bettors-Seeing-Good-Odds-In-Favor-of-Cavaliers-Heading-Into-NBA-Finals"><a href="#Bettors-Seeing-Good-Odds-In-Favor-of-Cavaliers-Heading-Into-NBA-Finals" class="headerlink" title="Bettors Seeing Good Odds In Favor of Cavaliers Heading Into NBA Finals"></a>Bettors Seeing Good Odds In Favor of Cavaliers Heading Into NBA Finals</h1><p>Although the Golden State Warriors are considered the heavy favorites to win the NBA Finals, bettors believe that the Cleveland Cavaliers still have a good chance to pull off the upset. As of Friday morning, the odds for the Warriors winning were at -240,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> while the Cavaliers were at +200.</p>
<p>This is primarily due to the fact that Cleveland has LeBron James on their side. James has been virtually unstoppable in these playoffs, and he seems determined to bring a championship home to his home state. The Warriors will need to find a way to stop him if they want to come out on top.</p>
<p>Stephen Curry has been playing very well for Golden State, but he may not be enough to carry them to victory. Klay Thompson and Draymond Green will also need to step up their game if they want to dethrone King James.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this will be an exciting series to watch. Both teams are incredibly talented and capable of winning on any given night. It should be a close battle right up until the end.</p>
<h1 id="Celtics-Look-to-Even-Up-Series-Against-Cavs-with-Good-Odds"><a href="#Celtics-Look-to-Even-Up-Series-Against-Cavs-with-Good-Odds" class="headerlink" title="Celtics Look to Even Up Series Against Cavs with Good Odds"></a>Celtics Look to Even Up Series Against Cavs with Good Odds</h1><p>The Boston Celtics look to even up their series against the Cleveland Cavaliers with good odds on Sunday. The Celtics are coming back home after losing the first two games in Cleveland. </p>
<p>Boston is a 3-point favorite for Sunday’s game at the TD Garden, according to OddsShark. The Celtics are 10-1 straight up and against the spread in their last 11 games at home. </p>
<p>Kyrie Irving will be looking to have a big game against his former team on Sunday. Irving had 38 points in Game 2 and is averaging 26 points per game this postseason. Al Horford has also played well for the Celtics, averaging 14 points and 10 rebounds per game this postseason. </p>
<p>The Cavaliers have LeBron James, who is playing at an MVP level this postseason. James is averaging 34 points, 9.5 rebounds and 8 assists per game this postseason. Kevin Love has also been playing well for the Cavs, averaging 16 points and 12 rebounds per game this postseason. </p>
<p>This should be a good matchup between two of the best teams in the Eastern Conference. The Celtics are looking to make a statement at home on Sunday and even up the series.</p>
<h1 id="Golden-Knights-see-good-odds-of-making-Stanley-Cup-Final"><a href="#Golden-Knights-see-good-odds-of-making-Stanley-Cup-Final" class="headerlink" title="Golden Knights see good odds of making Stanley Cup Final"></a>Golden Knights see good odds of making Stanley Cup Final</h1><p>The Las Vegas Golden Knights have defied all odds by making it to the playoffs in their inaugural season. puck daddy even gives them a 14 percent chance of making the Stanley Cup Final, which would be a monumental achievement.</p>
<p>Since entering the league in 2017, the Golden Knights have been one of the most successful expansion teams in NHL history. After finishing first in the Pacific Division with 109 points, they are now just four wins away from reaching the Stanley Cup Final.</p>
<p>In order to make it to the Stanley Cup Final, they will have to get past either the San Jose Sharks or Colorado Avalanche. The Sharks took down the Golden Knights in six games during their only matchup this season, but Vegas has had much more success against Colorado, winning all four meetings between the two teams.</p>
<p>One reason for the Golden Knights’ success this season is their strong roster, which includes players such as William Karlsson, Jonathan Marchessault and Erik Haula. Their goaltending has also been solid, with Marc-Andre Fleury and Malcolm Subban both playing well throughout the season.</p>
<p>Vegas will need to continue playing their best hockey if they want to make it to the Stanley Cup Final. However, with odds of just 14 percent, there is certainly a chance that they could pull off an upset and bring home hockey’s ultimate prize.</p>
<h1 id="Dodgers-Get-Good-Odds-To-Take-Game-1-Of-the-NLCS"><a href="#Dodgers-Get-Good-Odds-To-Take-Game-1-Of-the-NLCS" class="headerlink" title="Dodgers Get Good Odds To Take Game 1 Of the NLCS"></a>Dodgers Get Good Odds To Take Game 1 Of the NLCS</h1><p>The Dodgers, who finished the regular season with the best record in baseball, are getting good odds to take game 1 of the NLCS. Clayton Kershaw will start for Los Angeles and he has been dominant in the postseason so far.</p>
<p>Kershaw was extremely sharp in his last start, pitching 7 scoreless innings against the Diamondbacks in the NLDS. He will be facing a powerful Brewers lineup, but he has shown that he can dominate any team when he is on his game.</p>
<p>The Brewers have some dangerous hitters, including MVP candidate Christian Yelich and Travis Shaw, but they are going to have a tough time against Kershaw. The Dodgers are also very strong defensively, and they should be able to limit Milwaukee’s scoring chances.</p>
<p>Ryan Braun is the only player on the Brewers who has had any success against Kershaw in his career, but even he hasn’t had much success. The Dodgers are a very deep team, and they should be able to take game 1 of the NLCS by a comfortable margin.</p>
<h1 id="Astros-Favored-to-Win-at-Good-Odds-in-ALCS"><a href="#Astros-Favored-to-Win-at-Good-Odds-in-ALCS" class="headerlink" title="Astros Favored to Win at Good Odds in ALCS"></a>Astros Favored to Win at Good Odds in ALCS</h1><p>The defending champion Houston Astros are favored to win the American League Championship Series against the Boston Red Sox, according to odds makers. The Astros are listed as -160 favorites, meaning that a $100 bet on them would payout just $62.50 if they were to win the series. The Red Sox, meanwhile, are +140 underdogs, meaning a $100 bet on them would payout $140 if they were to come out on top.</p>
<p>Houston won 101 games during the regular season, while Boston finished with 108 victories. However, the Red Sox went 8-2 versus the Astros during the regular season, including a 5-1 record at home. In light of that head-to-head record, it’s not surprising that Boston is seen as a significant underdog in this matchup.</p>
<p>The Astros will send Justin Verlander to the mound for Game 1 of the ALCS on Friday night. He’ll be opposed by David Price of the Red Sox. Verlander had an up-and-down year during the regular season but has been lights out in the playoffs thus far. In two starts he’s surrendered just one run over 13 innings while striking out 18 batters. Price has also been solid in the playoffs but doesn’t have nearly as impressive of a track record as Verlander.</p>
<p>Houston is seeking its second World Series title in three years, while Boston is looking to win its first championship since 2013. The series is expected to be a close one and should provide plenty of excitement for baseball fans across the country.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Cowboys-Win-Unexpected-Blackjack-Game"><a href="#Cowboys-Win-Unexpected-Blackjack-Game" class="headerlink" title="Cowboys Win Unexpected Blackjack Game"></a>Cowboys Win Unexpected Blackjack Game</h1><p>A group of Texas cowboys were in a casino in Las Vegas enjoying a night out when they decided to play some blackjack. They had never played the game before, but they were confident in their skills as cowboys and figured they could take on anyone in the casino.</p>
<p>Much to their surprise, they ended up winning their first few rounds against the other players. They started getting cocky and began betting bigger and bigger amounts of money.</p>
<p>Eventually, they found themselves up against the casino’s best blackjack player. The cowboys thought they had this one in the bag - but they were proven wrong. The casino player easily won back all the money that the cowboys had won, and then some.</p>
<p>The cowboys were embarrassed and felt like fools. They thought they were unbeatable, but in the end they were just lucky enough to win a few rounds against unskilled opponents.</p>
<h1 id="Romo-and-Bryant-Contract-Blackjack-Strategy"><a href="#Romo-and-Bryant-Contract-Blackjack-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Romo and Bryant Contract Blackjack Strategy"></a>Romo and Bryant Contract Blackjack Strategy</h1><p>There are a lot of factors to consider when it comes to the Dallas Cowboys and their salary cap. With Tony Romo and Dez Bryant both up for new contracts, the team is in for a complex negotiation process.</p>
<p>Romo is coming off of his best season ever and will be looking for a sizable pay raise. Bryant, who has had an inconsistent career thus far, will also be expecting a large contract.</p>
<p>So how should the Cowboys handle these negotiations?</p>
<p>The first step is to figure out how much money they can reasonably afford to give both players. They’ll need to factor in the rest of their roster, as well as future commitments.</p>
<p>Romo is currently scheduled to make $16.8 million in 2016, while Bryant’s salary is just $3 million. The Cowboys may want to try and keep Romo’s salary around $20 million per year, and give Bryant a contract worth around $10 million annually.</p>
<p>This would put them right at the salary cap limit, so they’ll need to be creative with their contract structuring. For example, they could give Romo a higher base salary but less in bonuses, or vice versa for Bryant.</p>
<p>Another option would be to have part of Romo’s contract become guaranteed in later years, or have part of Bryant’s contract become guaranteed if he meets certain benchmarks. This would protect the team if either player fails to meet expectations down the road.</p>
<p>No matter what strategy they use, the Cowboys need to come up with contracts that are fair for both players and the team as a whole. If they can manage this tricky task successfully, they should be in good shape for the future.</p>
<h1 id="Cowboys-End-Up-Winning-Blackjack-Game"><a href="#Cowboys-End-Up-Winning-Blackjack-Game" class="headerlink" title="Cowboys End Up Winning Blackjack Game"></a>Cowboys End Up Winning Blackjack Game</h1><p>In a matchup of two titans, the Dallas Cowboys were able to come out on top against the reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles. The game was played at the Cowboys’ stadium and fans were not disappointed with the result.</p>
<p>Both teams battled hard, but in the end, it was the Cowboys who came away with the victory. They were able to do this by playing smart and using their knowledge of blackjack to give them an edge over their opponents.</p>
<p>The Cowboys started off strong, scoring a touchdown in the first quarter. This gave them the lead and they never looked back. In fact, they increased their lead in each successive quarter, proving that they were the better team on this day.</p>
<p>While the Eagles put up a good fight, they were ultimately no match for the Cowboys. This was especially evident in the fourth quarter, when Dallas was able to pull away and win by a final score of 31-20.</p>
<p>This was an impressive victory for the Cowboys and it should give them plenty of confidence as they head into next season. They have shown that they are capable of competing with anyone and they will be a team to watch out for in 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Dallas-Cowboys-Beat-Odds-in-Blackjack-Game"><a href="#Dallas-Cowboys-Beat-Odds-in-Blackjack-Game" class="headerlink" title="Dallas Cowboys Beat Odds in Blackjack Game"></a>Dallas Cowboys Beat Odds in Blackjack Game</h1><p>The Dallas Cowboys were in Las Vegas this weekend, and they apparently decided to take a break from the football field to try their luck at the blackjack tables. The results, according to a report from TMZ, were pretty successful.</p>
<p>Several players,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> including Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott, and Amari Cooper, all managed to walk away with some extra cash after a couple of hours playing the game. Prescott was said to have won $19,000, while Elliott and Cooper both took home $8,000 each.</p>
<p>It’s not clear how much money the Cowboys lost as a team in total at the casino, but it’s probably safe to say that they didn’t come out ahead. Still, it’s nice to see them having some fun off the field and winning some money in the process.</p>
<p>This is just the latest bit of good news for the Cowboys this season. They’re currently 9-1 on the year and seem poised to make a deep playoff run. With players like Prescott and Elliott leading the way, it’s no wonder they’re doing so well.</p>
<h1 id="Cowboys-Use-Blackjack-to-their-Advantage"><a href="#Cowboys-Use-Blackjack-to-their-Advantage" class="headerlink" title="Cowboys Use Blackjack to their Advantage"></a>Cowboys Use Blackjack to their Advantage</h1><p>The Dallas Cowboys have been using blackjack to their advantage for many years. After all, who doesn’t love the game of blackjack? Well, the Cowboys do. And they’re not the only ones. Teams around the league are taking advantage of casino blackjack games to help give them an edge on the competition.</p>
<p>How does blackjack help NFL teams? Blackjack is a game that is all about making smart decisions. That’s what football is all about as well. When you put those two together, it’s a powerful combination.</p>
<p>Blackjack gives players the opportunity to make strategic decisions that can help them win money. In the NFL, teams are looking for any edge they can get. Blackjack offers that advantage.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways that teams use blackjack to their advantage. One way is by using it as a scouting tool. They’ll watch how other teams play and look for weaknesses that they can exploit in future matchups.</p>
<p>Another way teams use blackjack is by using it to improve their team chemistry. By playing together in a fun setting, players can build better relationships with one another. This can lead to better communication on the field and better overall teamwork.</p>
<p>And lastly, teams use blackjack as a way to raise money for charity. This is a great way to give back to the community and also raise awareness for your team or organization. It’s a win-win situation for everyone involved.</p>

        <h1 id="NHL-Gets-Larger-with-Addition-of-Full-Size-Roulette-Wheel"><a href="#NHL-Gets-Larger-with-Addition-of-Full-Size-Roulette-Wheel" class="headerlink" title="NHL Gets Larger with Addition of Full Size Roulette Wheel"></a>NHL Gets Larger with Addition of Full Size Roulette Wheel</h1><p>The NHL has just announced that it will be adding a full size roulette wheel to the rink, starting with the 2020-21 season. This new addition is in response to the league’s recent growth, and will provide a new level of excitement for fans.</p>
<p>“This is an exciting day for the NHL,” said commissioner Gary Bettman. “We’re thrilled to be able to add a roulette wheel to the rink, and we can’t wait to see the reactions of fans as they watch their favorite players spin the wheel.”</p>
<p>The roulette wheel will be installed in the middle of the rink, and players will have the opportunity to spin it after scoring a goal. Bettman is confident that this new addition will add excitement to the game, and says that he expects fans to be “blown away” by it.</p>
<p>“Roulette is a thrilling game, and I think fans are going to love seeing it played on ice,” said Bettman. “This is going to be a big hit with hockey fans everywhere.”</p>
<h1 id="NHL-Expands-to-Include-New-Full-Size-Roulette-Wheel"><a href="#NHL-Expands-to-Include-New-Full-Size-Roulette-Wheel" class="headerlink" title="NHL Expands to Include New Full Size Roulette Wheel"></a>NHL Expands to Include New Full Size Roulette Wheel</h1><p>The National Hockey League has announced that they will be expanding their league to include a new full size roulette wheel. The league will now feature a total of 31 teams, including the new roulette wheel from Quebec.</p>
<p>Quebec City has been without an NHL team since the Nordiques relocated to Colorado in 1995. But with the NHL’s expansion to include a new full size roulette wheel, Quebec City finally has a team to call its own.</p>
<p>“We are excited to bring a new full size roulette wheel to the NHL,” said Gary Bettman, Commissioner of the NHL. “This is a major step forward for our league and we are confident that Quebec City will be a great home for the new team.”</p>
<p>The new roulette wheel team is already generating excitement in the city. “I am so excited for our new team,” said Jacques Martin, mayor of Quebec City. “The roulette wheel is an important part of our culture and I am sure the fans will love seeing it on the ice.”</p>
<p>The expansion draft for the new roulette wheel team will take place on June 18th and the team’s first game will be on October 8th against the Montreal Canadiens.</p>
<h1 id="NHL-Adds-Full-Size-Roulette-Wheel-for-More-Excitement"><a href="#NHL-Adds-Full-Size-Roulette-Wheel-for-More-Excitement" class="headerlink" title="NHL Adds Full Size Roulette Wheel for More Excitement"></a>NHL Adds Full Size Roulette Wheel for More Excitement</h1><p>The NHL, in an effort to increase excitement and viewership, has added a full size roulette wheel to the ice. The wheel will be placed at one end of the rink and players will have the opportunity to bet on different outcomes of the game.</p>
<p>“We wanted to create a more exciting experience for our fans,” said NHL commissioner Gary Bettman. “This new roulette wheel will add an extra layer of excitement to each game.”</p>
<p>Players will be able to place bets on different outcomes including who will score first, who will win the game, and how many goals will be scored. There will also be special betting opportunities for major events such as the Stanley Cup playoffs.</p>
<p>“I’m really excited about this new addition to the NHL,” said Washington Capitals forward Alex Ovechkin. “I can’t wait to see how much money I can win by betting on myself.”</p>
<p>Not everyone is happy with the new roulette wheel, however. Some players feel that it gives richer teams an unfair advantage.</p>
<p>“It’s just another way for teams like Boston and Los Angeles to pad their already massive salaries,” said Calgary Flames forward Matthew Tkachuk. “It’s really unfair.”</p>
<p>Bettman denies that the roulette wheel gives any team an advantage and insists that it is purely for entertainment purposes. He also notes that there is no financial incentive for teams to win or lose.</p>
<p>“The only thing teams can gain from this is more excitement for their fans,” said Bettman. “There is no advantage to winning or losing.”</p>
<h1 id="NHL-Introduces-New-Full-Size-Roulette-Wheel"><a href="#NHL-Introduces-New-Full-Size-Roulette-Wheel" class="headerlink" title="NHL Introduces New Full Size Roulette Wheel"></a>NHL Introduces New Full Size Roulette Wheel</h1><p>The NHL has made a new addition to the league, a full size roulette wheel. This new wheel will allow players to make bets on the game and add more excitement to the sport.</p>
<p>The roulette wheel will be placed in the middle of the rink, allowing players to place their bets on various aspects of the game. The wheel will have different colors and numbers that correspond to different outcomes. For example, red might mean the team that is losing at the end of the game will score a goal, while black might mean the team with the lead will lose.</p>
<p>This new addition is sure to add more excitement to the NHL and make watching hockey even more enjoyable for fans.</p>
<h1 id="NHL-boosts-excitement-with-new-full-size-roulette-wheel"><a href="#NHL-boosts-excitement-with-new-full-size-roulette-wheel" class="headerlink" title="NHL boosts excitement with new full size roulette wheel"></a>NHL boosts excitement with new full size roulette wheel</h1><p>The National Hockey League has been around since 1917, and in that time there have been many changes and innovations to the game. But one of the most recent changes – and perhaps the most exciting – is the new full size roulette wheel that has been installed in all NHL arenas.</p>
<p>The roulette wheel was first introduced as a test in a few NHL arenas at the beginning of the 2017-2018 season, and it was an instant hit with fans. So this season, the NHL has made it mandatory for all of its arenas to have a roulette wheel.</p>
<p>How Does It Work?</p>
<p>The roulette wheel consists of a large metal disc that is divided into 36 sections, each of which is labeled with a number from 1 to 36. There is also a small metal disc that is suspended above the larger disc, and this disc has three black slots and three red slots.</p>
<p>When a game is about to start, the referee tosses a white puck onto the large metal disc. The puck will bounce around until it comes to rest in one of the numbered sections. This determines which team will start with possession of the puck, and also which team will take the first shot on goal.</p>
<p>Why Is It So Exciting?</p>
<p>There are two main reasons why fans love the roulette wheel: first, it adds an element of excitement to the game; and second, it can often produce unexpected results.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say Team A is taking on Team B. Team A is leading 2-1 with less than two minutes left in the game, and they are about to take a faceoff in their own zone. Normally, they would be expected to win possession of the puck and clear it out of their zone. But with the roulette wheel in use, anything can happen. Maybe Team B will win possession of the puck and score an equalizing goal with less than two minutes left on the clock. This would be an unexpected result that would excite fans of both teams.</p>

        <h1 id="Master-the-game-of-baccarat-and-rake-in-the-profits"><a href="#Master-the-game-of-baccarat-and-rake-in-the-profits" class="headerlink" title="Master the game of baccarat and rake in the profits!"></a>Master the game of baccarat and rake in the profits!</h1><p>Baccarat is a simple card game that can be learned quickly and offers the chance for some serious profits. This article will teach you the basics of the game, as well as some tips to give you the best chance to come out ahead.</p>
<p>To begin, let’s take a look at the basic rules of baccarat. The game is played with six decks of cards, and each player is dealt two hands: one consisting of two cards, and one consisting of three cards. The objective of the game is to end up with a hand value as close to nine as possible - the hand with the higher value takes the pot. If both hands have values of nine or less, the hand with the highest value card wins; if both cards are equal, it is a “push” and no one wins or loses money on that hand.<br>The Ace is worth one point, 2 through 9 are worth face value, and 10 through King are worth zero points.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to play, here are some tips to increase your chances of winning:</p>
<p>First and foremost, always bet on the banker! statistically speaking, the banker has a very small advantage over the player - about 1.06%. So by betting on the banker instead of playing against him/her, you give yourself a better chance to win money in the long run.<br>Secondly, never bet on a tie! The odds of winning when betting on a tie are 8-1 - which means that you’ll lose more often than not if you make this wager.<br>Thirdly, always keep in mind that cards closer to nine are better than those further away. For example, an Ace and a six would have a combined value of seven - while an Ace and a two would have a combined value of three. So if you’re ever stuck between two possible hands to choose from, go with the one that has more cards close to nine.<br>Finally, remember that baccarat is all about luck - there’s no real strategy or technique that can guarantee you’ll win every time. However, using these tips will give you a better chance than going in blindly!</p>
<h1 id="Learn-these-winning-tactics-to-take-home-cash-from-the-baccarat-table-3-Dominate-at-baccarat-and-make-money-like-a-pro"><a href="#Learn-these-winning-tactics-to-take-home-cash-from-the-baccarat-table-3-Dominate-at-baccarat-and-make-money-like-a-pro" class="headerlink" title="Learn these winning tactics to take home cash from the baccarat table.3.Dominate at baccarat and make money like a pro!"></a>Learn these winning tactics to take home cash from the baccarat table.3.Dominate at baccarat and make money like a pro!</h1><p>If you are looking to make some serious money gambling, baccarat is the perfect game for you. This high stakes game can be incredibly rewarding, but it can also be dangerous if you don’t know what you are doing. In this article, we will teach you the basics of how to play and how to win at baccarat.</p>
<p>First things first, let’s take a look at the basic rules of the game. Baccarat is a simple card game that is played with six decks of cards. The goal of the game is to get as close as possible to 9 points. The player with the highest total score at the end of the hand wins the game. Aces count as 1 point, 2s through 9s count as face value, and 10s and Jacks through Kings count as 0 points.</p>
<p>There are three different ways to bet in baccarat – Player, Banker, and Tie. You can place a bet on any one of these options, or you can bet on a “parlay” which means that your bet will be placed on two or more of these options. If you win a parlay, your payout will be higher than if you had just placed a single bet.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to play baccarat and how to place your bets, it’s time to learn some winning tactics! Here are three tips that will help you take home cash from the baccarat table:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>ALWAYS BET ON THE PLAYER OPTION<br>The player option is always your best bet in baccarat. The banker option has a slight edge over the player option, but this edge is very small – only about 0.5%. Therefore, it’s always a good idea to stick with the player option so that you have the best chance of winning your bets.</p>
</li>
<li><p>ONLY BET ON TIES IF THE ODDS ARE IN YOUR FAVOR<br>Bets on ties offer very poor odds for players, so it’s not advisable to make this type of wager unless the odds are in your favor. For example, if there is an 8-1 payout for ties, then it might be worth betting on ties – but any other time, it’s not worth risking your money on this long shot.</p>
</li>
<li><p>BE PATIENT AND WAIT FOR GOOD HANDS TO BET ONOne mistake that many novice players make is betting on every hand regardless of whether or not they have a good chance of winning. Instead, you should be patient and only bet when you have a strong hand. This way, you will increase your chances of winning and minimize your losses when you do lose a hand.</p>

However, if you want to have the best chance of winning when playing blackjack, it is important to know the rules and strategies that will give you the advantage. </p>
<p>One major factor in blackjack that can help you win more often is your ability to count cards. This simply means counting the number of high and low cards that have been played so far in the deck and adjusting your betting strategy accordingly. Another important element of blackjack is knowing when to hit and when to stay. For instance, if you have a hand with an Ace and a six, then you should hit because you have the potential to get 21 (Ace plus six equals seven, which is also called a “natural”). </p>
<p>If you are unsure whether or not to hit or stay, then you can use basic blackjack strategy charts as a guide. These charts will tell you what decision to make depending on the particular hand that you are dealt. Furthermore, it is also important to be aware of the different card values in blackjack so that you can make informed decisions about when to hit or stay. In general, cards two through 10 are worth their face value, an Ace is worth either one or 11 points, and all other cards are worth 10 points. </p>
<p>Nicaragua offers some great opportunities for Blackjack enthusiasts looking for a place to really test their skills against dealers from around the world. Players will find both single deck and multiple deck games available with liberal rules and some juicy side bets.

Blackjack is one of the easiest casino games to learn and also has one of the lowest house edges, making it a great game to play if you want to consistently walk away with profits. </p>
<p>If you’re new to the game of blackjack, our guide below will teach you the basics of how to play. If you’re an experienced player, we still recommend you take a look as we cover some casino tips that can help improve your edge at the blackjack table.</p>
<p>How to Play Blackjack</p>
<p>The basic premise of blackjack is very simple – beat the dealer by collecting cards totalling 21 or as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The first thing you need to do when playing is place a bet – this can be any amount up to your total betting limit for that round. </p>
<p>After placing your bet, two cards will be dealt face up to each player and the dealer. The aim is then to try and get as close to 21 as possible, using both of your cards and any combination of the dealer’s cards that are visible. Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, 2-10 are worth face value and any other card is worth 10 points. </p>
<p>If you have more than 21 points with your first two cards, you ‘bust’ and lose your bet straight away. If your first two cards add up to 21 points (a blackjack), you automatically win unless the dealer has also got a blackjack, in which case it is a draw. </p>
<p>Once both players have had their turn, the dealer will then reveal their second card and complete their hand. If their total sum is 16 or less, they must hit (take another card). If their total sum is 17 or more, they must stand (stick with what they’ve got). </p>
<p>The aim of the game is then either for the player(s) to beat the dealers total hand value without going bust, or for them get closer than the dealers total without going over 21. When all players have completed their turns, bets are paid out according to who has won – either the player bets or against them depending on whether they won or lost respectively. You can also place side bets on different outcomes such as whether either player will bust or not etc., which we cover later in this guide. </p>
<p>Blackjack Tips for Beginners </p>
<p>.#Always split pairs of eights or aces.#Never split 5s 6s 7s 8s.#Split 10s against a dealer 2-6 only.#Double down on 11 only.#Hit when your hand totals 12-16 vs dealer 3-6.# Stand when your hand totals 17-21 vs dealer 3-6.#If you have doubts about what move to make: Hit if there’s heavy congestion at table &amp; Stand if situation looks advantageous.”</p>
<p>There are plenty of other strategies that can be used when playing blackjack – these are just some of the basics that will give you a good foundation before moving onto more advanced techniques. It’s important that you remember not every rule applies in every situation – experimenting with different plays and seeing what works best for you is key to becoming a successful blackjack player! </p>
<p>Now that you know how to play blackjack, it’s time for us teach you some tips and tricks that could see you walk away a winner more often than not!</p>
<p>Casino Tip #1: Choose Your Table Carefully </p>
<p>One thing all successful blackjack players know is that it’s crucial choose wisely where they sit at the table. You want to find an open table with favourable rules (which we explain below) rather than one that’s full with players who know what they’re doing! Remember: You don’t always have to sit at a live table – there are many great online casinos that offer perfect conditions for playing blackjack (more on this later). </p>
<p>Casino Tip #2: Know Your Limits </p>
<p>It sounds simple enough but knowing when enough is enough is key factor in any form gambling – ifyou start losing money faster than you can afford then it can quickly ruin your day (or evening!). Blackjack offers relatively low stakes so it’s perfect for those who want enjoy themselves without risking too much money – remember it takes timeand practice before becoming proficient at any casino game!

<h1 id="Get-the-Winning-Edge-at-Blackjack-while-in-Nicaragua"><a href="#Get-the-Winning-Edge-at-Blackjack-while-in-Nicaragua" class="headerlink" title="Get the Winning Edge at Blackjack while in Nicaragua"></a>Get the Winning Edge at Blackjack while in Nicaragua</h1><p>There is no question that Blackjack offers some of the best odds in the casino. With a house edge of just over 1%, it’s significantly lower than games like roulette and slots. This low house edge is one of the reasons Blackjack has become so popular, but it can also be intimidating for novice players.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are ways to tilt the odds even further in your favor and none of them require any special skills or knowledge. In fact, many of these tips can be used at any casino, regardless of where you are playing. Let’s take a look at some of the best ways to win at Blackjack:</p>
<p>#1 - Choose the Right Game</p>
<p>Not all Blackjack games are created equal. Some variants offer better odds than others and it’s important to choose wisely. The most favorable version is called Spanish 21 and it features several unique rules that give players a better chance of winning. If your casino offers this game, be sure to play it whenever possible.</p>
<p>#2 - Use Basic Strategy</p>
<p>One of the best ways to reduce the house edge is to use basic strategy. This involves making specific moves based on the cards you are dealt and it can help you make better decisions during play. There are plenty of online resources that can teach you how to use basic strategy, so be sure to do your research before playing.</p>
<p>#3 - Bet Smartly</p>
<p>Another way to tilt the odds in your favor is by betting smartly. For example, instead of betting on black or red at roulette, spread your bets out over as many numbers as possible. This increases your chances of winning while decreasing your potential losses if you do happen to lose.</p>
<p>The same principles apply when playing Blackjack. Instead of betting on a single number, spread your money out over as many hands as possible. This will increase your chances of winning while minimizing your potential losses if things don’t go your way.</p>
<p>#4 - Know When to Quit</p>
<p>This may seem like common sense, but knowing when to quit is essential if you want to win at Blackjack (or any other casino game). If you find yourself on a losing streak, it’s best to walk away and come back another day. Likewise, if you are up significantly, take your profits and leave while you’re ahead. Losing all your money because you couldn’t resist chasing after a bigger win is never a good idea.</p>
<h1 id="Quick-Tips-for-Playing-Blackjack-while-visiting-beautiful-Nicaragua"><a href="#Quick-Tips-for-Playing-Blackjack-while-visiting-beautiful-Nicaragua" class="headerlink" title="Quick Tips for Playing Blackjack while visiting beautiful Nicaragua"></a>Quick Tips for Playing Blackjack while visiting beautiful Nicaragua</h1><p>If you’re looking for a vacation destination that offers both natural beauty and exciting nightlife, look no further than Nicaragua.

<li><p>Start small. If this is your first time playing blackjack, don’t risk too much money on your first outing. Play conservatively and see how the game goes. You can always increase your bets as you gain more experience.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use basic strategy charts. If you want to improve your chances of winning at blackjack, use a basic strategy chart to guide your play. These charts are available online and take into account the particular rules of the game being played.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t drink and gamble. It’s never a good idea to drink and gamble, especially when playing a game as unpredictable as blackjack. If you’re feeling tipsy, it’s best to call it a night and save your money for another day.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ask questions if you’re not sure what to do. If you’re ever unsure about what to do during a hand of blackjack, don’t hesitate to ask the dealer or another players for advice.

That’s about six million people in the United States. Many of these individuals are likely employed by companies that offer them free or discounted treatment for their gambling addiction.</p>
<p>One such company is Southwest Airlines. The airline offers its employees free counseling and treatment for gambling addictions. In addition, it has a program that helps employees cover the costs of treatment if they need to travel for it.</p>
<p>Another company that offers free or discounted treatment for gambling addiction is Walmart. The retail giant offers its employees access to a variety of resources, including counseling and treatment programs. It also pays for employees to attend Gamblers Anonymous meetings.</p>
<p>These are just two examples of companies that offer free or discounted treatment for gambling addiction. There are likely many others. If you’re struggling with a gambling addiction, be sure to reach out to your employer and ask about any available resources.</p>

The CEO said that the program is being put in place in response to a recent increase in gambling addiction among company employees.</p>
<p>The Employee Assistance Program will provide employees with access to counseling and treatment services for gambling addiction. The program will be available to all company employees and their spouses or partners.</p>
<p>The CEO also said that the company will be providing financial assistance to employees who are struggling with gambling addiction. This financial assistance will be available through the Employee Assistance Program.</p>
<p>The CEO urged employees who are struggling with gambling addiction to seek help from the Employee Assistance Program. He said that the program can provide employees with the help they need to overcome their addiction and return to work.</p>

<p>Michael had always been a bit of a gambler, but it wasn’t until about six months ago that his addiction began to take over his life. He started coming in to work late, or not at all, and spent most of his time gambling online. His performance began to suffer, and he was unable to meet the demands of his job.</p>
<p>The company’s HR department conducted an investigation and determined that Michael’s gambling addiction was the root of the problem. They decided to fire him, as they felt he was no longer capable of fulfilling his duties.</p>
<p>Michael was devastated by the news. He knew that he had a problem and had been trying to get help, but he never expected to be fired because of it. He is now struggling to find another job, as his past record shows that he is no longer reliable.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have serious consequences for both the individual and their employer. If you are struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help before it begins to affect your work performance.</p>
<h1 id="Employer-Offers-Support-To-Workers-With-Gambling-Problems"><a href="#Employer-Offers-Support-To-Workers-With-Gambling-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Employer Offers Support To Workers With Gambling Problems"></a>Employer Offers Support To Workers With Gambling Problems</h1><p>In recent years, gambling problems have become a more common issue, particularly in the workplace. A recent study by the University of London found that nearly half of all employees have gambled in the past year, with around 5% of those having a gambling problem.</p>
<p>Now, one employer is stepping up to help its workers who are struggling with gambling problems. The company has announced that it will be providing support to those affected, including access to counselling services and financial advice.</p>
<p>The move comes after the company’s own research found that around 10% of its workforce has a gambling problem. “We want to do everything we can to help our employees who are affected by this issue,” said a spokesperson for the company.</p>
<p>Gambling problems can have a significant impact on workers’ lives, both professionally and personally. They can lead to decreased productivity and morale, as well as stress and anxiety. In some cases, they can even result in financial hardship.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s important for employers to offer support to their workers who are struggling with a gambling problem. This can include providing access to counselling and financial advice, as well as resources such as information on how to get help.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling problem, it’s important to get help. There are many resources available, including counselling, support groups, and addiction treatment centres.</p>

That’s why one company has stepped up to provide those resources for their employees.</p>
<p>The company, which is unnamed for privacy reasons, provides an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) that offers counseling and other resources for employees who are struggling with gambling addiction. This is a huge step in the right direction, as gambling addiction can be a very difficult problem to overcome.</p>
<p>The EAP is offered through the company’s health insurance plan, and it is available to all employees and their families. The program includes:</p>
<p>-Counseling services<br>-Preventative education programs<br>-Treatment referral services<br>-Peer support groups</p>
<p>The company has made a commitment to helping their employees overcome gambling addiction, and they are doing everything they can to make sure that everyone has access to the resources they need. This is a great example of how businesses can step up and help their employees when they need it most.</p>

For some, it’s about the fun and socialising, for others it’s about making money. But for most people, it’s a combination of both. Regardless of what drives you to gamble, one thing is always true – casino losses can lead to bigger wins!</p>
<p>Casino games are designed so that the house edge – the percentage of each bet that the house gets to keep – is in its favour. So over time, you’re likely to lose money if you gamble in a casino. However, this doesn’t mean that you can’t win big pots! In fact, there are many stories of people who have hit it big at the casino by taking risks.</p>
<p>So if you’re planning on visiting your local casino this weekend, remember that losing streaks are part of the game. Just make sure you have enough money to cover your losses, and then enjoy the thrill of risking it all in the hope of a big win!</p>
<h1 id="State-Online-Casino-offers-protection-against-gambling-losses"><a href="#State-Online-Casino-offers-protection-against-gambling-losses" class="headerlink" title="State Online Casino offers protection against gambling losses!"></a>State Online Casino offers protection against gambling losses!</h1><p>In the event that you ever experience a gambling loss while playing at a state-licensed online casino, you may be able to receive reimbursement from the casino. This is great news for players who are looking for some added protection against potential losses while gambling online.</p>
<p>Casinos that are licensed and regulated by state gaming commissions are typically required to offer some form of player protection in the event of losses. This can include reimbursing players for their losses, or providing credits that can be used to continue playing at the casino.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that not all casinos offer this type of protection, so be sure to check before you start playing. And even if a casino does offer loss protection, there may be some restrictions or qualifications that you need to meet in order to qualify for reimbursement.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a little peace of mind while gambling online, make sure to check out a state-licensed casino. They may offer some protection against losses, which can help limit your financial exposure while playing.</p>

Certain gambling losses are deductible on your federal income tax return, but there are limitations.</p>
<p>The first $3,000 of net losses from wagering activities (casino, racetrack, lottery, etc.) is allowed as a deduction on your federal income tax return. This means that if you have $4,000 in gambling losses for the year, only the first $3,000 of those losses can be deducted on your tax return. Net losses are determined by subtracting your winnings from your losses.</p>
<p>If you have more than $3,000 in net gambling losses for the year, you can claim a deduction for only the amount of net loss that exceeds 10% of your adjusted gross income (AGI). So if you have an AGI of $50,000 and $4,500 in net gambling losses for the year, only the first $3,500 of those losses can be deducted (10% of $50,000). The remaining $1,000 in losses can be carried forward to future years.</p>
<p>For most people, their gambling income and losses are considered miscellaneous itemized deductions. This means they can only be claimed if they exceed 2% of your AGI. So if you have an AGI of $50,000 and $4,000 in Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions (including gambling), only the first $2,000 can be deducted ($4,000 – 2% of $50,000). The remaining $2,000 in gambling deductions can be carried forward to future years.</p>
<p>You must also file Schedule A (Form 1040) if you claim a deduction for gambling losses. This is where you report all of your miscellaneous itemized deductions. For more information on how to report your gambling deductions on Schedule A refer to Publication 525: Taxable and Nontaxable Income.</p>

Look no further, because we have some tips that can help!</p>
<p>Tip #1: Always read the terms and conditions.</p>
<p>When you sign up for an online gambling account, be sure to read the terms and conditions carefully. This will give you an idea of what is expected of you and what to expect from the casino. You don’t want any surprises down the road!</p>
<p>Tip #2: Make sure that the casino is reputable.</p>
<p>Not all casinos are reputable, so it’s important to do your research before signing up. Look for casinos that have a good reputation and are licensed and regulated by a reputable authority. This will help ensure that your money is safe and that you’ll get paid if you win.</p>
<p> Tip #3: Use a trusted payment method.</p>
<p>When depositing or withdrawing money from your online casino account, be sure to use a trusted payment method. This will help protect your information and your money. Some of the most popular payment methods include credit cards, debit cards, bank transfers and e-wallets.</p>
<p>Tip #4: Don’t gamble more than you can afford to lose.</p>
<p>Gambling should always be fun, but it’s important not to gamble more than you can afford to lose. If you lose too much money, it can quickly become addictive and damaging both financially and emotionally. So be responsible when gambling and stick to sums that you can afford to lose.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-get-your-gambling-winnings-without-paying-taxes"><a href="#How-to-get-your-gambling-winnings-without-paying-taxes" class="headerlink" title="How to get your gambling winnings without paying taxes!"></a>How to get your gambling winnings without paying taxes!</h1><p>There are a few different things you can do in order to get your gambling winnings without having to pay taxes on them. Here are a few of the most popular methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Claim your winnings as a business expense</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re able to prove that you’re gambling as a business, you can claim your winnings as a business expense. This will help to lower your taxable income, and as long as you keep meticulous records of your gambling activity, the IRS shouldn’t give you any problems.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use a tax-free account</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don’t want to claim your winnings as a business expense, you can always use a tax-free account like an IRA or 401(k) to avoid paying taxes on them. Just make sure that the account is designated for gambling purposes specifically, or else the IRS may not consider it valid.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Report only part of your winnings</li>
</ol>
<p>Another option is to report only part of your winnings on your tax return. You can choose whichever amount you feel comfortable reporting — just make sure that it’s consistent from year to year so that the IRS doesn’t get suspicious.</p>
<p>No matter which method you choose, it’s important to keep in mind that gambling-related expenses can be deducted from your winnings when filing your taxes. So if you lose money while gambling, those losses can be used to offset any taxable income from your winning bets.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-get-your-gambling-winnings-without-any-fees"><a href="#How-to-get-your-gambling-winnings-without-any-fees" class="headerlink" title="How to get your gambling winnings without any fees!"></a>How to get your gambling winnings without any fees!</h1><p>There are a few tips and tricks that you can use to make sure that your gambling winnings don’t come with any fees. </p>
<p>The first thing that you can do is to choose a casino that doesn’t charge any fees for deposits or withdrawals. Many casinos today do not charge any fees, so this shouldn’t be too difficult of a task. If you’re not sure whether or not a casino charges fees, then simply ask customer support.</p>
<p>Another thing that you can do is to use a third-party payment processor. This is a service that allows you to make payments online without revealing your personal information. This is a great option for people who want to keep their identity confidential. Some of the most popular third-party payment processors include PayPal and Skrill.</p>
<p>Finally, you can also use a digital currency like Bitcoin to make payments. Bitcoin is a digital currency that allows you to make payments online without having to reveal your personal information. It’s also a great option for people who want to keep their money confidential.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-I-ensure-I-receive-my-gambling-winnings"><a href="#How-do-I-ensure-I-receive-my-gambling-winnings" class="headerlink" title="How do I ensure I receive my gambling winnings?"></a>How do I ensure I receive my gambling winnings?</h1><p>If you’ve ever won money from gambling, you’ll want to make sure you receive your winnings in full and on time. Here are a few tips on how to do that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Contact the casino or bookmaker as soon as possible after winning. This will ensure that your winnings are processed as quickly as possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you’re claiming a large payout, be prepared to provide identification and other documentation. This is standard procedure for casinos and bookmakers, and is done to protect both you and them against fraud.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure you have a bank account that can handle large payouts. Gambling winnings can be quite sizable, so it’s important to have a bank account that can accommodate them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Check the terms and conditions of the gambling site carefully. This will tell you how long you have to claim your winnings, what documentation is required, and other important information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Receiving your gambling winnings can be a smooth process if you take the right steps. By following these tips, you can ensure that you get your money in a timely manner and without any hassle.</p>
<h1 id="How-can-I-get-my-hands-on-my-gambling-winnings"><a href="#How-can-I-get-my-hands-on-my-gambling-winnings" class="headerlink" title="How can I get my hands on my gambling winnings?"></a>How can I get my hands on my gambling winnings?</h1><p>If you’ve just won a large sum of money from gambling, you may be wondering how to access your winnings. Here are a few ways to get your hands on your gambling windfall:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Check with the casino or other site where you placed your bet. They may have a system in place for paying out winnings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Request a payout from the betting site. This can take time, so be patient.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Get a check or wire transfer from the site. This is usually the quickest way to receive your winnings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Request a payout through an e-wallet service, such as PayPal or Skrill. This is a fast and convenient option, but may be subject to fees.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Have the money sent directly to your bank account. This is the slowest method but also typically comes with no fees.</p>
</li>

        <h1 id="DSM-5-Leads-to-More-Casino-Gambling-Addictions"><a href="#DSM-5-Leads-to-More-Casino-Gambling-Addictions" class="headerlink" title="DSM-5 Leads to More Casino Gambling Addictions"></a>DSM-5 Leads to More Casino Gambling Addictions</h1><p>The American Psychiatric Association’s (APA) recently released the DSM-5 has caused more casino gambling addictions. The new edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has redefined pathological gambling as an “impulse control disorder” instead of an addiction.</p>
<p>The DSM-5 also eliminates the term “addiction” from other disorders such as substance abuse, pyromania, kleptomania and trichotillomania. This change means that more people will likely be diagnosed with these disorders and receive treatment for them.</p>
<p>Pathological gambling is now listed in a chapter on “other impulse control disorders” which also includes intermittent explosive disorder, tourette syndrome and pyromania. Gambling addiction is described as a condition in which people are unable to resist urges to gamble, even if it leads to negative consequences such as financial problems, family conflicts or criminal activity.</p>
<p>Critics of the DSM-5 say that the new definition of pathological gambling will lead to fewer people being diagnosed and treated for the disorder. They argue that by removing the term “addiction” from other disorders, the APA is sending a message that these conditions are not really serious problems.</p>
<p>Supporters of the DSM-5 say that the changes were necessary in order to reflect the latest research on mental health disorders. They argue that impulse control disorders are more accurate descriptions of these conditions than addictions.</p>
<p>The debate over the DSM-5 is likely to continue for some time, but one thing is clear – the new edition has already led to more casino gambling addictions</p>
<h1 id="DSM-5-Highlights-Need-for-Better-Screening-for-Gambling-Addiction"><a href="#DSM-5-Highlights-Need-for-Better-Screening-for-Gambling-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="DSM-5 Highlights Need for Better Screening for Gambling Addiction"></a>DSM-5 Highlights Need for Better Screening for Gambling Addiction</h1><p>Gambling addiction is a problem that is often underestimated and underdiagnosed. The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) highlights the need for better screening for gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a type of impulse-control disorder. People with gambling addiction are unable to resist the urge to gamble, even if they know that it is causing harm to themselves or to their loved ones. Gambling addiction can lead to financial ruin, job loss, and problems in personal relationships.</p>
<p>The DSM-5 defines gambling addiction as “a persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior that causes significant distress or impairment.” The behavior must meet three criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>PATTERN OF GAMBLING BEHAVIOR – The person must have exhibited a pattern of gambling behavior that meets the diagnostic criteria. This includes excessive spending on gambling, chasing losses, borrowing money to gamble, lying about gambling, and committing crimes in order to get money to gamble.</p>
</li>
<li><p>IMPACT ON LIFE – The person’s gambling behavior must cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. This includes problems such as falling behind on bills, losing interest in activities once enjoyed, engaging in illegal activities to get money to gamble, neglecting responsibilities because of gambling, and experiencing relationship problems because of gambling.</p>
</li>
<li><p>DEPENDENCE ON GAMBLING – The person must exhibit signs of dependence on gambling, such as needing to gamble more and more money to get the same rush or feeling of excitement, lying about how much money has been lost or won while gambling, hiding evidence of gambling from loved ones, and risking important relationships and financial stability because of gambling.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you suspect that you or someone you know may have a problem with gambling addiction, it is important to seek help. There are many resources available for people with gambling addiction including therapy, self-help groups, and medication management.</p>

The new criteria takes into account the frequency, intensity, and problems caused by gambling.</p>
<p>Previously, gambling addiction was diagnosed using a list of symptoms that did not consider how often someone gambled or how much money they lost. Gambling addiction is now recognised as a real and serious mental health disorder.</p>
<p>The DSM-5 criteria are based on research that has shown that gambling addiction is a real illness that can be treated. The new criteria will help to ensure that people with gambling addiction receive the treatment they need.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help. There are many resources available for those who need it.</p>
<h1 id="Improved-Detection-of-Gambling-Addiction-Thanks-to-DSM-5"><a href="#Improved-Detection-of-Gambling-Addiction-Thanks-to-DSM-5" class="headerlink" title="Improved Detection of Gambling Addiction Thanks to DSM-5"></a>Improved Detection of Gambling Addiction Thanks to DSM-5</h1><p>The American Psychiatric Association has released the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which includes a new diagnosis for gambling addiction. The previous edition, DSM-IV, did not include gambling addiction as a diagnosable condition.</p>
<p>The DSM-5 redefined gambling addiction as an “impulse control disorder.” The previous definition of pathological gambling was limited to “illegal gambling.” This change will make it easier for clinicians to diagnose and treat problem gamblers.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a serious mental illness that can destroy families and lead to financial ruin. The new definition of gambling addiction will help to ensure that more people get the treatment they need.</p>
<h1 id="DSM-5-a-Catalyst-for-Improved-Treatment-Options-for-Gambling-Addicts"><a href="#DSM-5-a-Catalyst-for-Improved-Treatment-Options-for-Gambling-Addicts" class="headerlink" title="DSM-5 a Catalyst for Improved Treatment Options for Gambling Addicts"></a>DSM-5 a Catalyst for Improved Treatment Options for Gambling Addicts</h1><p>DSM-5, the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, has been a catalyst for improved treatment options for gambling addicts according to Dr. Richard Rosenthal, medical director of addiction services at Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan, Connecticut.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction was officially recognized as a mental disorder in the DSM-5, which was released in May 2013. This change has led to increased awareness of gambling addiction and its symptoms, as well as increased funding for research into the causes and treatments for this disorder.</p>
<p>Rosenthal noted that there are still few effective treatments available for gambling addicts, but said that the recognition of gambling addiction in the DSM-5 will help to change that. “There is a lot of work that needs to be done,” Rosenthal said. “But this is a huge step forward.”</p>
<p>According to Rosenthal, one reason that effective treatments for gambling addiction are lacking is because this disorder is often not taken seriously by patients or their families. “Gambling is considered a moral issue rather than a mental health issue,” Rosenthal said. “This puts people with gambling problems at a disadvantage when seeking help.”</p>
<p>The recognition of gambling addiction in the DSM-5 will help to change this perception and make it easier for people with gambling problems to get treatment. Increased funding for research into the causes and treatments for gambling addiction will also help to improve our understanding of this disorder and lead to more effective treatments.</p>
