        <h1 id="What-are-the-odds-of-the-Denver-Broncos-making-it-to-the-Super-Bowl-this-year"><a href="#What-are-the-odds-of-the-Denver-Broncos-making-it-to-the-Super-Bowl-this-year" class="headerlink" title="What are the odds of the Denver Broncos making it to the Super Bowl this year?"></a>What are the odds of the Denver Broncos making it to the Super Bowl this year?</h1><p>The Denver Broncos are coming off of a Super Bowl 50 victory, but what are the odds of them making it back to the Super Bowl this year?</p>
<p>To start with, the Broncos have an 8.5 percent chance of winning the Super Bowl this year, according to [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.betchicago.com/nfl-betting-odds-mile-high-city-team">https://www.betchicago.com/nfl-betting-odds-mile-high-city-team</a> BetChicago]. This puts them in third place behind the New England Patriots (9.5 percent) and the Philadelphia Eagles (10 percent).</p>
<p>There are a few factors that could play into the Broncos’ odds this year. One is that they have a new head coach, Vic Fangio. While he has some experience as a defensive coordinator, this will be his first time as a head coach in the NFL. Another factor is their quarterback situation. They have two quarterbacks, Case Keenum and Joe Flacco, who both have mixed records. Keenum had a good season last year with the Minnesota Vikings, while Flacco had a poor season last year with the Baltimore Ravens. Finally, there is also the question of how well wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders will recover from his Achilles injury.</p>
<p>All things considered, it’s unclear whether or not the Broncos will be able to make it back to the Super Bowl this year. However, they are certainly not out of contention yet and should not be counted out.</p>
<h1 id="Did-the-NHL’s-Board-of-Governors-unanimously-approve-the-expansion-team-in-Las-Vegas"><a href="#Did-the-NHL’s-Board-of-Governors-unanimously-approve-the-expansion-team-in-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Did the NHL’s Board of Governors unanimously approve the expansion team in Las Vegas?"></a>Did the NHL’s Board of Governors unanimously approve the expansion team in Las Vegas?</h1><p>Yes, the NHL’s Board of Governors unanimously approved the expansion team in Las Vegas on Wednesday, June 22. Reportedly, there were no objections to the proposed team name - the Vegas Golden Knights.</p>
<p>This is huge news for Sin City and its ever-growing sports scene! In addition to professional baseball, basketball, and football teams, Las Vegas will now have an NHL franchise. The new Golden Knights team will join the league in 2017-2018 as its 31st member.</p>
<p>The Board of Governors made their decision after a lengthy review process that included a visit to Las Vegas by deputy commissioner Bill Daly in May. Daly was impressed with what he saw and said: “Las Vegas is a world-class city with a passionate hockey market.”</p>
<p>NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman added that the league is “thrilled” to be expanding into Las Vegas. He also praised the city’s commitment to building a top-notch arena, which will be home to the new Golden Knights team.</p>
<p>The 17,500-seat arena is scheduled to open in October 2017 and will be used for more than just hockey games. It will also host concerts and other major events.</p>
<p>The addition of a Las Vegas team is sure to heat up competition in the Western Conference, where teams are already battling for playoff spots. Hockey fans in Nevada are in for some exciting games over the next few years!</p>
<h1 id="Who-will-be-the-starting-quarterback-for-the-Broncos-this-year"><a href="#Who-will-be-the-starting-quarterback-for-the-Broncos-this-year" class="headerlink" title="Who will be the starting quarterback for the Broncos this year?"></a>Who will be the starting quarterback for the Broncos this year?</h1><p>The Denver Broncos have an intense competition for the starting quarterback job this year. The current front runners are Trevor Siemian and Paxton Lynch.</p>
<p>Trevor Siemian was the starter last year, but he is not a lock to keep the job. He had some good moments last year, but he also had some bad moments. He will need to improve if he wants to keep the job.</p>
<p>Paxton Lynch was drafted in the first round of the 2016 NFL draft. He has a lot of potential, but he is still unproven. He will need to show that he can be a consistent quarterback if he wants to win the starting job.</p>
<p>There are also other contenders for the job, including Mark Sanchez and Austin Davis. The competition is going to be intense, and it will be interesting to see who emerges as the starter.</p>
<h1 id="How-much-money-did-the-NHL-make-in-television-rights-deals-for-the-2017-2021-season"><a href="#How-much-money-did-the-NHL-make-in-television-rights-deals-for-the-2017-2021-season" class="headerlink" title="How much money did the NHL make in television rights deals for the 2017-2021 season?"></a>How much money did the NHL make in television rights deals for the 2017-2021 season?</h1><p>The NHL secured a whopping $5.232 billion in television rights deals for the 2017-2021 season, according to Forbes. This is a significant increase from the league’s previous deal, which was worth $2.391 billion.</p>
<p>NBCUniversal will pay the NHL $2.66 billion over the next four years for exclusive rights to broadcast regular season and playoff games in the U.S. The network also secured digital streaming rights for its NBC Sports app.</p>
<p>ESPN and Turner Sports will pay a combined $1.792 billion for broadcasting rights in Canada and throughout Latin America. Rogers Communications, which owns Sportsnet, will pay the NHL $523 million over the next four years for exclusive Canadian broadcast rights.</p>
<p>These deals are a major win for the NHL, as they will provide the league with significantly more revenue than in past seasons. This additional money will help the NHL to further grow its business and improve its competitive standing against other leagues, such as the NBA and NFL.</p>
<h1 id="When-does-the-new-Las-Vegas-NHL-team-start-playing"><a href="#When-does-the-new-Las-Vegas-NHL-team-start-playing" class="headerlink" title="When does the new Las Vegas NHL team start playing?"></a>When does the new Las Vegas NHL team start playing?</h1><p>In 2020, the NHL bids for a new team in Las Vegas were finally accepted. The new Las Vegas NHL team, the Golden Knights, will start playing in the 2017-2018 season. There has been a lot of excitement in the city ever since the announcement was made.</p>
<p>The team will play at the T-Mobile Arena, which is located just west of the Strip on Paradise Road. The arena seats 17,500 fans and is also home to the WNBA’s Las Vegas Aces and the NHL’s Vegas Golden Knights. It is also host to major concerts and other events.</p>
<p>In preparation for their first season in the NHL, the Golden Knights have been filling their coaching staff and front office positions. They have also been signing players to their roster. So far, they have signed goaltender Maxime Lagace and defenseman Jon Merrill.</p>
<p>The Golden Knights are hoping to make a big impact in their first season in the NHL. With all of the excitement in Las Vegas surrounding them, there is no doubt that they will be one of the most popular teams in the league!</p>
