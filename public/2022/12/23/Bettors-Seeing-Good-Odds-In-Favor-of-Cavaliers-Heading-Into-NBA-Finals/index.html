        <h1 id="Bettors-Seeing-Good-Odds-In-Favor-of-Cavaliers-Heading-Into-NBA-Finals"><a href="#Bettors-Seeing-Good-Odds-In-Favor-of-Cavaliers-Heading-Into-NBA-Finals" class="headerlink" title="Bettors Seeing Good Odds In Favor of Cavaliers Heading Into NBA Finals"></a>Bettors Seeing Good Odds In Favor of Cavaliers Heading Into NBA Finals</h1><p>Although the Golden State Warriors are considered the heavy favorites to win the NBA Finals, bettors believe that the Cleveland Cavaliers still have a good chance to pull off the upset. As of Friday morning, the odds for the Warriors winning were at -240,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> while the Cavaliers were at +200.</p>
<p>This is primarily due to the fact that Cleveland has LeBron James on their side. James has been virtually unstoppable in these playoffs, and he seems determined to bring a championship home to his home state. The Warriors will need to find a way to stop him if they want to come out on top.</p>
<p>Stephen Curry has been playing very well for Golden State, but he may not be enough to carry them to victory. Klay Thompson and Draymond Green will also need to step up their game if they want to dethrone King James.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this will be an exciting series to watch. Both teams are incredibly talented and capable of winning on any given night. It should be a close battle right up until the end.</p>
<h1 id="Celtics-Look-to-Even-Up-Series-Against-Cavs-with-Good-Odds"><a href="#Celtics-Look-to-Even-Up-Series-Against-Cavs-with-Good-Odds" class="headerlink" title="Celtics Look to Even Up Series Against Cavs with Good Odds"></a>Celtics Look to Even Up Series Against Cavs with Good Odds</h1><p>The Boston Celtics look to even up their series against the Cleveland Cavaliers with good odds on Sunday. The Celtics are coming back home after losing the first two games in Cleveland. </p>
<p>Boston is a 3-point favorite for Sunday’s game at the TD Garden, according to OddsShark. The Celtics are 10-1 straight up and against the spread in their last 11 games at home. </p>
<p>Kyrie Irving will be looking to have a big game against his former team on Sunday. Irving had 38 points in Game 2 and is averaging 26 points per game this postseason. Al Horford has also played well for the Celtics, averaging 14 points and 10 rebounds per game this postseason. </p>
<p>The Cavaliers have LeBron James, who is playing at an MVP level this postseason. James is averaging 34 points, 9.5 rebounds and 8 assists per game this postseason. Kevin Love has also been playing well for the Cavs, averaging 16 points and 12 rebounds per game this postseason. </p>
<p>This should be a good matchup between two of the best teams in the Eastern Conference. The Celtics are looking to make a statement at home on Sunday and even up the series.</p>
<h1 id="Golden-Knights-see-good-odds-of-making-Stanley-Cup-Final"><a href="#Golden-Knights-see-good-odds-of-making-Stanley-Cup-Final" class="headerlink" title="Golden Knights see good odds of making Stanley Cup Final"></a>Golden Knights see good odds of making Stanley Cup Final</h1><p>The Las Vegas Golden Knights have defied all odds by making it to the playoffs in their inaugural season. puck daddy even gives them a 14 percent chance of making the Stanley Cup Final, which would be a monumental achievement.</p>
<p>Since entering the league in 2017, the Golden Knights have been one of the most successful expansion teams in NHL history. After finishing first in the Pacific Division with 109 points, they are now just four wins away from reaching the Stanley Cup Final.</p>
<p>In order to make it to the Stanley Cup Final, they will have to get past either the San Jose Sharks or Colorado Avalanche. The Sharks took down the Golden Knights in six games during their only matchup this season, but Vegas has had much more success against Colorado, winning all four meetings between the two teams.</p>
<p>One reason for the Golden Knights’ success this season is their strong roster, which includes players such as William Karlsson, Jonathan Marchessault and Erik Haula. Their goaltending has also been solid, with Marc-Andre Fleury and Malcolm Subban both playing well throughout the season.</p>
<p>Vegas will need to continue playing their best hockey if they want to make it to the Stanley Cup Final. However, with odds of just 14 percent, there is certainly a chance that they could pull off an upset and bring home hockey’s ultimate prize.</p>
<h1 id="Dodgers-Get-Good-Odds-To-Take-Game-1-Of-the-NLCS"><a href="#Dodgers-Get-Good-Odds-To-Take-Game-1-Of-the-NLCS" class="headerlink" title="Dodgers Get Good Odds To Take Game 1 Of the NLCS"></a>Dodgers Get Good Odds To Take Game 1 Of the NLCS</h1><p>The Dodgers, who finished the regular season with the best record in baseball, are getting good odds to take game 1 of the NLCS. Clayton Kershaw will start for Los Angeles and he has been dominant in the postseason so far.</p>
<p>Kershaw was extremely sharp in his last start, pitching 7 scoreless innings against the Diamondbacks in the NLDS. He will be facing a powerful Brewers lineup, but he has shown that he can dominate any team when he is on his game.</p>
<p>The Brewers have some dangerous hitters, including MVP candidate Christian Yelich and Travis Shaw, but they are going to have a tough time against Kershaw. The Dodgers are also very strong defensively, and they should be able to limit Milwaukee’s scoring chances.</p>
<p>Ryan Braun is the only player on the Brewers who has had any success against Kershaw in his career, but even he hasn’t had much success. The Dodgers are a very deep team, and they should be able to take game 1 of the NLCS by a comfortable margin.</p>
<h1 id="Astros-Favored-to-Win-at-Good-Odds-in-ALCS"><a href="#Astros-Favored-to-Win-at-Good-Odds-in-ALCS" class="headerlink" title="Astros Favored to Win at Good Odds in ALCS"></a>Astros Favored to Win at Good Odds in ALCS</h1><p>The defending champion Houston Astros are favored to win the American League Championship Series against the Boston Red Sox, according to odds makers. The Astros are listed as -160 favorites, meaning that a $100 bet on them would payout just $62.50 if they were to win the series. The Red Sox, meanwhile, are +140 underdogs, meaning a $100 bet on them would payout $140 if they were to come out on top.</p>
<p>Houston won 101 games during the regular season, while Boston finished with 108 victories. However, the Red Sox went 8-2 versus the Astros during the regular season, including a 5-1 record at home. In light of that head-to-head record, it’s not surprising that Boston is seen as a significant underdog in this matchup.</p>
<p>The Astros will send Justin Verlander to the mound for Game 1 of the ALCS on Friday night. He’ll be opposed by David Price of the Red Sox. Verlander had an up-and-down year during the regular season but has been lights out in the playoffs thus far. In two starts he’s surrendered just one run over 13 innings while striking out 18 batters. Price has also been solid in the playoffs but doesn’t have nearly as impressive of a track record as Verlander.</p>
<p>Houston is seeking its second World Series title in three years, while Boston is looking to win its first championship since 2013. The series is expected to be a close one and should provide plenty of excitement for baseball fans across the country.</p>
