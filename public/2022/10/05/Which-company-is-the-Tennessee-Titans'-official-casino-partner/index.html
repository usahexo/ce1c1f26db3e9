        <h1 id="Which-company-is-the-Tennessee-Titans’-official-casino-partner"><a href="#Which-company-is-the-Tennessee-Titans’-official-casino-partner" class="headerlink" title="Which company is the Tennessee Titans’ official casino partner?"></a>Which company is the Tennessee Titans’ official casino partner?</h1><p>The Tennessee Titans have announced that the team has entered into a multi-year agreement with the Las Vegas Sands Corporation to make the casino the official casino partner of the Titans. The partnership will give the casino branding and marketing rights at Nissan Stadium, and also includes a number of fan engagement initiatives.</p>
<p>“The Tennessee Titans are proud to partner with Las Vegas Sands Corporation as our official casino partner,” said Titans CEO Steve Underwood. “Sands has a world-class brand and strong presence in Tennessee, and we look forward to working together to create unique and memorable experiences for our fans.”</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, Sands will be given a variety of branding and marketing opportunities at Nissan Stadium, including prominent placement of their logo on digital scoreboards and throughout the venue, as well as opportunities to interact with fans through activations such as interactive kiosks and contests. The company will also be a presenting sponsor of two of the Titans’ preseason games this year.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the Titans have partnered with a casino company; in 2013, they entered into a deal with Churchill Downs Incorporated, which owns several casinos including Churchill Downs Racetrack in Louisville, Kentucky. That partnership was largely focused on consumer promotions and giveaways, such as free tickets to races at Churchill Downs.</p>
<p>It’s not clear what specific activations Sands will be undertaking as part of this new agreement, but it’s likely that they will focus on trying to attract new customers from Tennessee. The company already operates four casinos in the state - The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino, Palazzo Resort Hotel Casino, Sands Expo Center, and Circus Circus Reno - so it’s likely that they see this deal as an opportunity to increase market share.</p>
<p>Tennessee is one of the few states where gambling is legal outside of tribal lands. In fact, Nashville recently passed a measure allowing for three new casinos to be built in Davidson County; while no specific operators have been announced yet, it’s likely that Sands will be among those vying for one of those licenses.</p>
<h1 id="What-do-the-Tennessee-Titans’-casino-partners-offer-their-fans"><a href="#What-do-the-Tennessee-Titans’-casino-partners-offer-their-fans" class="headerlink" title="What do the Tennessee Titans’ casino partners offer their fans?"></a>What do the Tennessee Titans’ casino partners offer their fans?</h1><p>The Titans’ casino partners offer their fans a variety of experiences, including sports betting, live and virtual casino gaming, and poker. For sports fans, the opportunity to place bets on games is a major attraction. In addition to the excitement of gambling on games, there are also bonuses available for players. Some casinos offer players the chance to earn points that can be redeemed for merchandise or special offers.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy casino games, the experience of playing real-life games against other players is available through live casino gaming. Alternatively, if players would rather play against the computer, virtual casino gaming offers many different types of games. Poker is another popular draw and the Titan’s casino partners have several options for poker lovers. Players can choose between cash games and tournaments with different buy-in amounts. There are also various prizes available in tournaments, making them an attractive option for many players.</p>
<h1 id="How-did-the-Tennessee-Titans’-casino-partnership-come-about"><a href="#How-did-the-Tennessee-Titans’-casino-partnership-come-about" class="headerlink" title="How did the Tennessee Titans’ casino partnership come about?"></a>How did the Tennessee Titans’ casino partnership come about?</h1><p>In a move that has surprised many in the NFL, the Tennessee Titans announced a casino partnership with WinStar World Casino and Resort. The deal is reported to be for $35 million over 10 years and will see WinStar become the “official casino” of the team.</p>
<p>The Titans are not the only team to partner with a casino, but this is by far the most lucrative deal. The Philadelphia Eagles have a deal with SugarHouse Casino worth $10 million over five years, while the Cleveland Browns have a deal with Jack Entertainment worth $7 million over four years.</p>
<p>Why did the Titans decide to go with such a massive deal? And what impact will it have on the team?</p>
<p>There are likely several reasons behind the Titans’ decision to partner with WinStar. First, gambling is legal in Tennessee, so it’s a natural market for WinStar. Second, the casino is based in Oklahoma, which is close to Tennessee. This gives WinStar a significant advantage over other casinos when it comes to marketing their product to Tennesseans.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that the Titans are coming off a disappointing season and could use the extra money to improve their team. The $35 million over 10 years amounts to $3.5 million per year, which is significantly more than what any other team has received from a casino partnership.</p>
<p>So far, there hasn’t been much backlash against the Titans for forming this partnership. In fact, many people seem to be quite happy about it. This could be because gambling is already popular in Tennessee, or it could simply be that people are happy that the team is trying to improve its fortunes on the field.</p>
<p>Only time will tell how successful this partnership turns out to be for both the Titans and WinStar World Casino and Resort. However, if things go well, there’s no doubt other teams will start looking into similar deals with casinos in their own states.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-benefits-of-being-a-Tennessee-Titans’-casino-partner"><a href="#What-are-the-benefits-of-being-a-Tennessee-Titans’-casino-partner" class="headerlink" title="What are the benefits of being a Tennessee Titans’ casino partner?"></a>What are the benefits of being a Tennessee Titans’ casino partner?</h1><p>There are a few benefits of being a Tennessee Titans casino partner. The first is that you get access to some of the best game tickets in the NFL. If you’re looking for a VIP experience, then being a casino partner is the way to go. You also have the chance to sponsor some of the Titans’ biggest events, like the Family Football Festivals or their charity golf tournaments. By partnering with the Titans, you’re showing your support for one of the most popular teams in the NFL, and you’re helping to raise money for some great causes.</p>
<h1 id="How-does-the-Tennessee-Titans’-casino-partnership-differ-from-other-NFL-partnerships"><a href="#How-does-the-Tennessee-Titans’-casino-partnership-differ-from-other-NFL-partnerships" class="headerlink" title="How does the Tennessee Titans’ casino partnership differ from other NFL partnerships?"></a>How does the Tennessee Titans’ casino partnership differ from other NFL partnerships?</h1><p>The Tennessee Titans announced a casino partnership with the Gold Strike Casino in Tunica, Mississippi, in May of 2018. This is the first casino partnership for an NFL team. The deal will give the Titans’ exclusive rights to promote the casino and to have branded areas inside and outside of it. The Titans are also expected to receive a sponsorship fee and share in any profits from the casino.</p>
<p>This differs from other NFL partnerships, which generally involve stadiums or team merchandise. For example, the New England Patriots have a sponsorship deal with Gillette Stadium, while the Dallas Cowboys have a sponsorship deal with Ford Motor Company. Deals like these typically include marketing rights as well as signage and branding opportunities inside and outside of the stadium.</p>
<p>So why did the Titans choose a casino partnership instead? One reason may be that casinos are becoming more popular as tourist destinations. In fact, Tunica County (where Gold Strike Casino is located) saw a 9% increase in tourism in 2017. And with states such as Tennessee legalizing gambling, casinos may become even more popular in the future.</p>
<p>Another reason for the Titans’ casino partnership may be that casinos offer a different type of sponsorship opportunity than traditional sports sponsorships. For example, casinos can sponsor events such as concerts or boxing matches. This could provide additional revenue streams for NFL teams looking to partner with casinos.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if other NFL teams follow the Titans’ lead and enter into partnerships with casinos. If they do, it could be good news for casinos looking to expand their branding and marketing efforts.</p>
